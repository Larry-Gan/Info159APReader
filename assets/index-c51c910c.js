`,Text:`ORLANDO, FL—As part of an increase in programming aimed toward strengthening a relationship with a key demographic, a new Golf Channel show that debuted Tuesday night is reportedly just a 30-minute praising of the Saudi royals. “I can’t say enough about how much good the House of Saud has done for the sport of golf, as well as for America and the world in general,” Saudi Golf Today co-host Jimmy Roberts said as the latest praise from the golf world for the ruling family of Saudi Arabia scrolled in a ticker across the bottom of the stream. The veteran sportscaster went on to ask a panel of analysts to name their favorite thing about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “In addition to just being a bunch of really good, standup guys, the Saudis are true champions of golf. [Saudi Arabian public investment head] Yasir Al-Rumayyan and his top-notch team over there are absolutely committed to elevating the public profile and prestige of golf around the world, and it’s really incredible to see what they’ve done with their courses. You haven’t played a true round of 18 holes until you’ve played them at Royal Greens or Dirab. Stay tuned, because coming up in the next hour we’ve got pictures of Saudi royal family members playing golf while a live studio audience applauds.” Roberts added that he didn’t want the show to shy away from controversial issues, so he wished to state the Golf Channel’s official position that the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was well deserved.

DeSantis has repeatedly criticized Dr. Seuss’ famous character the Grinch for not being overtly Jewish enough.
According to DeSantis, this book promotes harmful socialist ideology by creating in children the expectation that everyone will, in fact, get dim sum.
Wrongly encourages Black people to travel by car.
DeSantis famously rejects Albert Camus’ existentialist embrace of the absurd and instead favors a more Sartrean realism, as explored in the governor favorite philosophical work, Being And Nothingness.
Holden should’ve been meaner to the prostitute.
DeSantis deemed the book’s depiction of Humbert Humbert to be disrespectful to the state’s many pedophiles.
No characters named Ron.
A gateway book that leads some Floridians to a lifetime love of reading.
The removal of pornography from classrooms includes the obscene story of James and his presumably fat ass.
Too scary.
He feels threatened by Kristy’s work ethic.
Children could be tempted by circles and their devious curves.
Briefly mentions Robert Todd Lincoln had a buddy who was Black.
He thought this one dragged in the middle.
DeSantis banned this, in addition to several other pregnancy books, out of concern that learning about the process of childbirth would lead women to seek abortions.
Shoves news literacy down children’s throats.
The State of Florida bans all books that depict or even acknowledge the existence of Seattle.
Incorrectly introduces the idea that children may be able to hide from a fascist state.

`,Text:`LEE’S SUMMIT, MO—Expressing concern over the youngster’s suspiciously sparse work history and total lack of professional references, local factory manager Toby Walters asked a 12-year-old job applicant Tuesday to explain a 12-year employment gap on his résumé. “So, it says here, young man, that you haven’t had a job since you were zero years old—that’s an awfully long time to just be sitting at home, unemployed,” said Walters, adding that he could understand if the seventh-grader had taken off a few years here and there to take care of an aging relative, recover from an illness, or start a family, but failing to keep a steady job for his entire young life was a bit of a stretch. “Look, I don’t mean to be harsh, but I have several applicants here who are 12 years old and have held down jobs all their lives. It didn’t matter if they were homeless, sick, or even had a limb cut off right here in the factory. How are you supposed to compete with them when you haven’t been employed since you left the womb? Now you’re basically aging out of the workforce.” At press time, Walters told reporters he decided to give the 12-year-old upstart a chance, with the caveat that he fully expected his newest employee to immediately die on the job.

This is not what social media is for.
Framing your abortion as a weight-loss technique unfortunately doesn’t make it any less illegal.
No need to throw it in our faces.
Nana wanted that to stay in the family.

Post all the cooking tutorials you want, but you will forevermore be known as a harlot who gets abortions.
Awfully suspicious, if you ask the antiabortion crowd.
At least throw a sad face in there to seem a little down about it.
Younger generations are tired of hearing how cheap and accessible healthcare used to be.
It’s not necessary for people to know you were listening to that new ABBA album from last year and an episode of Revisionist History with Malcolm Gladwell.
You lost pretty much everyone who uses social media at “nuanced.”
Pretending you simply lost the fetus growing inside you probably won’t hold up in court.
While it’s admittedly a dank meme, it’s highly inappropriate.
No one young enough to conceive uses LOL anymore.

`,Text:`SAN DIEGO—Remaining unhoused despite the brave sacrifices he made to keep America safe, sources reported Friday that Tinker, a local dolphin trained to kill by the U.S. military in the 1960s, was found lying destitute under a bridge downtown. “It’s really sad, after everything they went through in Vietnam, to see these dolphins neglected by the government that turned them into ruthless killing machines,” said marine mammal rights advocate Paula Redford, explaining that few benefits were available to such dolphins, though many lost fins or even noses protecting U.S. submarines from undersea mines. “Tinker here was drafted into the Navy and did two tours of duty in Cam Ranh Bay, where his sole mission was to identify and neutralize enemy swimmers trying to attack a vital ammunition pier. When he came back, he wasn’t the same, and he was soon dismissed from his job at SeaWorld for maiming a family of tourists. But Tinker was just doing what his government had taught him to do. Today, he continues to suffer flashbacks from the experimental hallucinogens he was administered in the MK-Ultra program, and as you can see from the pipe sticking out of his blowhole, he is addicted to crack.” Redford added that until someone helps them get off the street and into a habitable cove or aquarium, dolphins like Tinker would continue to sit wrapped in dirty blankets, clinking their tin cans and asking passersby for spare krill.

If the onboarding process at your job involves taking any kind of vows of chastity, this would qualify as a direct conflict.
Rude people like this deserve to be confronted.

This type of hypocrisy from your employees is unacceptable.
As a sexless worker drone, it’s important you sniff out those who would impair the workflow with their carnal needs.
And ignore them in person as always.
Since you both know you don’t make enough for a meal at a nice restaurant, discuss options ahead of time.
It’s amazing how you can work with someone for years and not know these basic aspects of their personal life.
It’s technically not sexual harassment if you don’t end with a question mark.
Always good to play it cool and show interest in their lives.
This is really a compliment if you think about it.

The program itself will be a high-pressure, stressful environment that mimics the reality of working under a tech CEO who is unable to control their own emotions, puts employees under constant threat of being fired, and often does fire them, only to ask them to return to work a week later when everything starts breaking down.” Kepner added that the STEM program would also cater to women and minorities by showing them how to comply with the sexist and racist environment that a reckless, self-absorbed tech CEO fosters.

`,Text:`FAIRFAX, VA—In the wake of a mass shooting that left seven elementary schoolers dead and nine more injured, the National Rifle Association issued a statement Thursday congratulating the school shooter for his terrific aim given such small targets. “When a situation like this happens, you’ve just got to give it up for a guy who’s capable of nailing that many kids well under four feet tall, plus they move quick—it’s very impressive,” said NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, specifically highlighting an incredibly impressive shot where the gunman hit a second-grader from 100 feet away while on the run. “There are a lot of really outstanding school shooters out there, but we want to congratulate this shooter specifically for choosing a higher difficulty level than a high school, where the targets are so much larger. Anyone over age 10 or so is just easier to hit. To be able to nail a kid in the head in the small gap between two desks is an incredibly impressive shot, especially since the shooter is only 19 years old. To those who question American exceptionalism, we’d like to point you to this promising young man’s terrific aim.” The NRA also praised the shooter for his choice of weapon, saying that the AR-15 was simply the tool you needed to use if you wanted to get the job done right.

`,Text:`AUSTIN, TX—Reeling in the wake of a difficult loss in the Texas gubernatorial race, Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke reportedly asked his advisors Wednesday if getting paralyzed by a tree might help his 2026 election chances. “Look, we’ve got to be honest with ourselves and admit something is holding me back as a candidate, and if that’s my ability to walk, then, sure, I’d stand in the path of a falling oak tree,” O’Rourke said during an impromptu huddle with his closest aides in which he asked how much polling  had been done on the hypothetical scenario of a freak accident leaving him tragically confined to a wheelchair before the next governor’s election. “Let’s imagine I get a four- or five-point bump with Hispanics after they see a photo of me in a wheelchair. If we’re talking about turning Texas blue, then who the hell knows what I’m willing to sacrifice? Anyway, let’s fire up some focus groups ASAP, because this having two functional legs shit is clearly not working.” At press time, O’Rourke added that it couldn’t hurt to throw in a question about whether it would help his electability to get married to Greg Abbott’s wife.

`,Text:`When working in an office setting, it’s important to leave your genitals at the door. Here are the biggest reasons not to sleep with a coworker.
No one should ever have to sleep with anyone in finance.
More than hearts can get broken out there on the gridiron.
Letting your coworker stay overnight during the week is one thing, but it could lead to a  serious, uncomfortable conversation about carpooling to save money.
Don’t become one of those people who actually looks forward to going to their job each day because they get to see someone they’re sleeping with there.
If they were really smart or attractive, they’d be somewhere else by now.
You did read the employee code of conduct, right?
Yeah, you wouldn’t want to jeopardize the job that’s slowly killing you for a mind-blowing taboo fuckfest.
Oh, she knows about you and that slut, and she’s going to wring your flirtatious little necks.
One is fine, but two is just plain stupid.
Once emotions get involved, it can make unnecessary downsizing that much more challenging.
You might want to avoid having sex with coworkers who consistently come down with super-resistant gonorrhea.
It’s pretty embarrassing to be shamed with your picture in the company newsletter.
A healthy economy requires a large gene pool.
Because let’s face it, you’re really bad at sex.
It’s only season two. Be patient.
The two of you might think you’re being subtle, but it’s quite obvious that you’re sucking each other’s genitals under the table.
You both somehow managed to end up in the same dead-end dump of an office, so fornicating is at least a bit dangerous.
Fair is fair.
You barely manage the workload you have now.
It’s not worth all the work of locating their grave and digging up the body just to rekindle your office romance.
There’s a reason the Taco Bell corporate handbook expressly forbids it.
There’s still stacks and stacks of papers to read through!
Do something original for once in your life, like having sex with a family member.
Jesus died because he hooked up with a coworker on the same product development team.
Did your digital workplace-conduct course teach you nothing?
Fuck up the ladder, not sideways.
The man will spend half the ’90s​ unfairly ridiculing you like you’re some kind of slut.
Tacky.

`,Text:`LEAWOOD, KS—In a rollout of what the theater chain has dubbed “experience-based pricing,” AMC announced Tuesday that they were now basing ticket prices on proximity to a guy masturbating in the dark. “Starting Feb. 10, the cost of tickets will depend entirely on how close customers sit to a middle-aged man who is clearly jerking off in one of our many theaters,” said CEO Adam Aron, adding that the man’s location would be clearly marked on the seating chart with the words “public masturbator,” and customers would pay more or less depending on where they sat in relation to him. “In our most expensive ‘Preferred Sightline’ tier, customers will be able to sit so far away from the man that they can neither see nor hear him masturbating. In our ‘Standard Tier,’ they’ll be able to see the shadowy outline of the man’s hunched-over body and will likely be able to hear some heavy breathing and grunting. And in our least expensive ‘Value Sightline Tier,’ customers will sit directly next to the man as he puts the absolute bare minimum effort into hiding what he’s doing. At this tier, we strongly advise customers to refrain from making eye contact or looking inside the masturbating man’s popcorn carton.” At press time, Aron revealed that as an added incentive for signing up for AMC’s monthly membership program, customers would soon be able to pay to be the masturbating man.

Don’t go too far in comparing the former running back’s incredible on- and off-field work with Tom Brady’s Hertz campaign.
Comparing their favorite player to Hitler is sure to bother anyone, even if Brady eventually comes out on top.
Keeping the conversation centered around Brady’s Super Bowl wins, and not his unwise promotion of cryptocurrency, is generally a good call.
Fans of Brady acknowledge that this is technically true, but would prefer to downplay the connection.
Middle-aged white guys can’t process what you just said but it won’t stop them from saying something sexist and racist.
One of history’s big what-ifs. Brady fans can only dream.
Most Tom Brady fans are holding out hope that he’ll continue to play at least into his ’90s.
Shut up, nerd!
Many fans are sensitive to the fact that he’s old and decrepit.
There’s simply too many to count.
Good sentiment but wrong conversation.
This point is a sore spot for Brady fans who lament the fact he’s never suffered from scurvy in his life.
What else is he gonna do?
Say this and you’ll have most Tom Brady fans singing the blues.
Before dating a Brady fan, seriously consider whether you want to always be second place to the Buccaneers quarterback.
Tom Brady fans just can’t choose between his most exciting eight-yard completions.
For the third straight year, he didn’t come to Gronk’s birthday and it just crushed him.
Great, now they’re in motion.
Worth a try just to see if you can irritate one of these people for a while.

Brady fans hate being reminded of the old crone’s curse.
His fans hate to admit this, but Tom Brady is a really stupid name compared to Joe “The Comeback Kid” Montana.

`,Text:`Most innovators are mocked in their own time. Doubters and naysayers always do their best to stifle bold thinking, though in my case, I refused to let the negative voices get to me. I knew I’d live to see the day when my greatest idea would be vindicated, and that’s exactly what happened. They laughed me off as a crazy person when I said we were going to sell the common chicken as food. Well, you know what? I’m the one laughing now.
Back in 1991, when I took over Perdue Farms, everyone told me it was ludicrous to believe anyone would be interested in eating a simple farm bird. What about the beaks, they said, what about the feathers? They would wince and turn up their noses at the mere word “chicken.” But now you can’t walk into a grocery store anywhere in this country without seeing shelves full of the stuff, and it’s all thanks to yours truly.
I remember the day I first proposed to my colleagues the idea that chicken could be eaten. You should have seen the looks of revulsion on the Perdue board members’ faces. The moment the picture of the chicken popped up in my PowerPoint presentation, the entire table started to scoff and jeer. “That’s your big idea?” they said. “Those egg-laying creatures with the talons that scuttle around in their own shit? That’s absolutely disgusting.” They told me I would run the company into the ground if I didn’t give up on this unhinged scheme to put chicken on the shopping list of every American family. And when I persisted, every last one of them resigned.
Now I have a $6.5 billion empire built on the common chicken, and what do the people who doubted me have? Nothing!
Sure, it took a fair share of trial and error before I figured out how to make the common chicken edible. I tried everything—mashing their entire bodies into a pulp, boiling the waddles for hours on end, blending their necks and livers into a frothy soup—all the while convinced that if I just found the right method of preparation, the critics would be silenced. This went on for years. It wasn’t until I tried cutting off the head and feet and serving the meat instead of the bones that I realized I might have something big on my hands. Boy did I ever!
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Dealing with the criticism wasn’t always easy, though. There were times when I had to ask myself, “Are they right about me and my chickens? Maybe they do belong in the coop as far away from people as possible.” But the more others called it madness to hack up chickens and stay awake for days on end cooking them in my basement, the more I knew I had to prove the cynics wrong.
And I showed them, by golly. I showed them all.
I had to sacrifice everything to achieve my goal of bringing the common chicken to the masses. My friends abandoned me, my father disowned me. My wife left me, too. She’d say, “Jim, why can’t you just sell cow like everybody else?” If I came upstairs with a single stray feather on my shirt, she’d gag and heave, and I never got her to eat one measly bite of chicken. Well, now that I’m a chicken billionaire, you can bet she’s eating her words.
These days, chicken is served the whole world over. The same people who used to say domesticated fowl should only be fed to criminals and dogs are now going out to their favorite restaurants and ordering—guess what?—chicken. And of course, every company wants a piece of the chicken action, whether it’s KFC, Tyson, or Chick-fil-A, but they’re imitators, imitators all! I was the first, and I laughed all the way to the bank.
I’ll be laughing even harder once my new line of 100-percent genuine chicken-skin jackets, shoes, and accessories takes off.

`,Text:`VATICAN CITY—In a progressive step forward for the Catholic Church, Pope Francis declared Thursday that there was nothing wrong with a guy giving his buddy a tug job after a few drinks. “We are all children of God, and sometimes those children start feeling lonely after happy hour and one thing leads to another,” said Francis, whose remarks about any sexual acts that might theoretically occur in a pickup truck outside Ruby Tuesday were hailed by LGBTQ groups as “confusing but encouraging.” “It’s not a crime if you’re both a bit tipsy and your friend unzips his pants. Male or female, God views all hands equally. What happens, happens, as long as you never speak about the moment ever again. It’s still a sin, of course. Just say a Hail Mary afterward and you’re good to go.” At press time, Francis added that Catholics could choose not to oblige a buddy, but they should understand that doing so would seriously leave their friend in the lurch.

Ultimately, we couldn’t have done it without numerous violations that will result in the suspension of multiple players and coaches, and nobody can take that away from us, even though there will be calls to vacate our championship after this all gets out in the open.” At press time, Astros owner Jim Crane reportedly congratulated the team for carrying out the subject of the investigation in such a way as to keep him immune from punishment.

Under the new directive from the mayor’s office, Father Christmas was  seized by New York City police officers, who noted in their report that the man was babbling senselessly about possessing magical powers, and that the large sack he carried was obstructing the sidewalk. The decision drew backlash from critics who argued that Adams’ new policy would hamper, if not completely destroy, the joyful and beloved Christmas holiday. According to sources, Santa was unrecognizable after orderlies at Bellevue Hospital shaved his head and beard and injected a dose of Haldol into his neck that blocked all the Christmas spirit in his body. At press time, Adams had defended himself by presenting a list of names and addresses of children apprehended from Santa’s pocket.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—In a new study that leading economists have called a sobering assessment of social mobility in the United States, researchers at the Brookings Institution have determined the majority of the nation’s residents end up dying within the same commercial trash compactor they were born into. “Our data show that few Americans ever escape the 15-ton industrial waste disposals of their birth, as almost no one can overcome the crushing pressure of a heavy-duty trash compactor without significant outside help,” said researcher Tessa Stein, explaining that opportunities were limited inside trash compactors, which were not designed with people in mind but rather for the purpose of pulverizing garbage and reducing it to the smallest size possible. “One disadvantage of trash compactors is that they tend to be food deserts, with few options available for a healthy diet and almost none of them fresh. Compared to other wealthy nations, the United States sees a far greater percentage of its citizens condemned to the same trash compactor, shredder, of incinerator their family has occupied for generations.” Critics of the study have argued that if Americans are being crushed by 100,000 pounds of pressure inside a solid-steel box, it should only provide them with even more incentive to try to lift themselves up by their bootstraps.

Of course, Christ insisted to any doubting apostles that God had specifically told him that he needed hundreds of donkeys for his sacred work. And if that wasn’t effective, he would just accuse everyone of trying to betray him.” Turner added that a related finding suggested Christ used the glitz and glamor of the donkeys to convince dozens of his young female followers to sleep with him.

`,Text:`WUHAN, CHINA—Claiming the aquatic mammal had squandered the countless opportunities it had been given, wildlife experts reported Tuesday that the Chinese river dolphin, a species that had an entire 25-million-year period to evolve ways to survive, was pathetically snuffed out by less than a decade of environmental changes.
According to researchers, the dolphin—which hasn’t been spotted in the wild for several years and has been declared functionally extinct—evidently “sat around with its thumb up its ass” for epochs before being caught completely off guard by only eight short years of increasing industrial runoff and overfishing within its Yangtze River habitat.
“Chinese river dolphins had literally millions of generations to develop stronger staminas or at least expand their habitat beyond a single river, but they couldn’t get their act together, and now look at them,” said exasperated marine biologist Susan Reese, who explained that if the animal had even a shred of survival instinct, it would have evolved a specialized internal organ to process and filter toxic chemicals instead of wasting all its time developing an elongated beak. “Sure, they figured out how to communicate through series of whistles and clicks, but they couldn’t even be bothered to take some time to learn how not to get tangled up in fishing nets and drown all over the goddamn place. Unbelievable.”
“Maybe a few million years ago they should have paused a moment to consider how to block out underwater noise pollution that affects their echolocation so that they wouldn’t just keel over the second motorboat traffic increased,” Reese continued, referring to the species’ “completely embarrassing” tendency to become disoriented in the murky river water and swim into rotating propeller blades. “Christ Almighty, these morons had all the time in the world to figure this stuff out.”
Rolling her eyes as she spoke with reporters, Reese noted that the dolphin had existed 100 times as long as modern humans, somehow surviving violent continental drift and several ice ages, but never once put any thought or effort into developing razor-sharp teeth or claws to hunt prey beyond the fish stocks that have been depleted by high-voltage electrical-charge fishing, basically ensuring the lousy species would die off in just a few measly years.
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Additionally, while experts admitted that the animal’s streamlined body and ability to swim up to 40 miles per hour were steps in the right direction, they maintained that the species hadn’t taken such adaptations nearly far enough and was “pretty much begging” to be rendered extinct, citing the relative ease with which the dolphin was hunted for its skin and meat.
“No camouflage to make them virtually invisible to hunters? No plated armor strong enough to withstand steel spears? No nothing? Let’s be honest here: These dolphins had their chance, and they absolutely blew it,” said zoologist William Nagle, who explained how the cetaceans must have just screwed around for hundreds of millennia. “They had a 24-million-year head start on us, and yet they didn’t even figure out how to have more than one offspring at a time to increase the chances of more of their kind reaching sexual maturity and propagating the species. Given how fast their population dropped in the last few years, I wouldn’t be surprised if these idiots died of sheer embarrassment.”
Experts stated that humans, feeling pity for how badly the species had botched its evolution, took several specimens into captivity several years ago. However, despite having had since the Neogene period to prepare themselves and develop traits necessary to live in a changing ecosystem, the creatures were so functionally inept that most couldn’t even work out a way to survive for more than a few months in the small tanks they were kept in.
“We tried to give them a chance, but each one croaked quicker than the last, the stupid losers,” Nagle said. “I’m sorry, but if you’re not even going to try to help yourself, then why the hell should anyone else bother to help you?”
“Frankly, these dipshits deserved to go extinct,” he added.

`,Text:`LONDON—In an effort to get past the acrimony stirred up by a recent Netflix documentary, Prince William and Prince Harry reportedly settled their  dispute Monday by announcing arranged marriages between their children.  “This allows us to put to rest all that nasty feuding and get down to  what really matters, which is breeding the royal family,” said Prince  William, who stressed that the marriage between his 7-year-old  daughter, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Harry’s 3-year-old son, Archie  Mountbatten-Windsor, would head off any potential strife by ensuring  their bloodlines were forever entwined. “Of course, Harry’s son is  technically not even a prince, but that’s really neither here nor there.  Since time immemorial, the monarchy has avoided disturbances in the  kingdom through strategic marriages, and this one looks highly  promising. They’re not too closely related, merely first cousins, so  hopefully only a few of their children will have hemophilia.” Prince William went on to reveal that the wedding would be in summer  2023.

`,Text:`ATLANTA—Making use of a fully automated feature that enables the vehicle to release itself from the guilt and shame of past mistakes, a self-loving Tesla reportedly forgave itself Monday for running over a 6-year-old in a crosswalk on a residential street. “The AI operating system of this Tesla Model 3 allowed it to instantaneously experience and let go of any negative emotions it may have felt after accidentally slamming into a small child today and ending her life,” said Tesla engineer Howard Lucas, who, when reached for comment on the deadly collision, explained how a self-loving algorithm processes nearly a billion points of raw data so the vehicle can cut itself some slack and not beat itself up too much when it registers an impact with a person age 12 or younger. “With neural networks that can complete up to 144 trillion operations per second, the self-loving Tesla was able to move efficiently through every stage of grief without even attending the candlelight vigil being held tonight at the deceased first-grader’s elementary school. An autonomous emotion-processing system then accepted the Tesla just the way it was and chose not to hold the car to an unrealistic standard of stopping every single time a pedestrian crossed the street.” According to reports, the self-loving Tesla, which had gotten over the idea that it always had to be perfect and recognized that we all mess up sometimes, was last seen traveling at 80 mph through a school zone.

`,Text:`PORTSMOUTH,  NH—Saying they had to be realistic about what their current situation  entailed, married couple Brett and Hannah Steinwald told reporters  Tuesday that they were taking their struggle to get pregnant as a sign that they should keep trying until their relationship eventually implodes.  “Look, if we aren’t pregnant after over a year,  we eventually  need to read the writing on the wall and keep obsessing about having a  child until we’re so filled with spite and resentment that our marriage  collapses,” said Hannah Steinwald, stressing that she and her husband  should be honest about the fact that even if becoming parents wasn’t in  the cards, they could still grow increasingly embittered over years of  visits with fertility experts and emotionally-vacant sex while the few  ties holding them together frayed and eventually snapped. “Say we never  have kids: Does that mean we can’t secretly blame each other for  destroying our dream of parenthood? Or that once things fizzle out in  three or four years, we aren’t going to have a painful divorce?  Absolutely not.” Steinwald added that she  was really trying to use  this moment to look at her spouse less as the person she loved, and more  as a set of misfiring genitals that had completely and utterly failed her.
`},66:{URL:"https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-s-style-guide-to-always-supporting-the-police-1849846649",Title:`The Onion’s Style Guide To Always Supporting The Police
`,Text:`Police face an incredibly difficult task in maintaining order in a barbaric hellscape like America, and journalistic ethics require news sources like The Onion to report the truth accurately from the officers’ perspective. Amid ongoing criticism of how the media portrays violent acts by law enforcement, we’re sharing The Onion’s official in-house style guide to ensuring that our news reports always support the police.
All children are rounded up to adults: Any child older than 5 harmed by police is automatically age-advanced to 18, while we refer to those 4 and under as “mature juveniles.”
No “excessive” violence: Instead of “excessive” aggression, we use “generous,” “bountiful,” or “family-size.”
The phrase “was found dead” should be used as often as possible: It’s better for everyone this way. 
Sources = Police: All sources should be a neutral witness wearing a cop uniform.
Black men are never “unarmed”: A cell phone or water gun could be lethal in certain circumstances. It’s not for a responsible reporter to speculate. Also, fists could be weapons. Or feet. Or eyes. Really, the list is endless. 
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Use “altercation”: In addition to keeping things vague, it’s a great SAT word.
Police never fire bullets: Any bullet from a police officer’s firearm must be described as “emitting spontaneously from a self-firing gun” or “appearing in the victim’s body as if by magic.”
Don’t assume that getting shot hurts: Until someone describes the pain, our report should first consider that gunshots feel good.
Omit needless words: When describing police-involved shootings, omit words and phrases that aren’t key to the story, like “while running away,” “in the back,” and “child.”
And God willed it thus: In a scenario where a suspect dies in police custody, always end with this phrase.

`,Text:`Since purchasing Twitter for $44 billion, Elon Musk has reportedly attempted to cut costs by eliminating some 3,700 jobs. The Onion asked several former employees how they felt about being laid off, and this is what they said.
“If Mr. Musk deems it necessary, I can only assume it’s for some very intelligent and well-thought-out reason.”
“Thankfully my Nazi-platforming experience sets me up pretty good for another job at a different social network.”
“I knew the writing was on the wall the second I did my job competently.”
“I left after Mr. Musk asked where I saw myself five kids from now.”
“I filmed a video résumé of me dancing to Lizzo’s “About Damn Time,” so I’m sure TikTok will get back to me about a job soon.”
“I refused to open the email I got, so for all I know, I still work there.”
“It’s nice to be fired for something besides sexual harassment for once.”
“It’s heartbreaking to think how difficult it will be to continue the important work of destroying democracy from someplace like LinkedIn or Shopify.”
“I can always get another job working for one of the other wealthy people who hates and disrespects me.”
“I was pretty worried. Thankfully I got a job offer from Twitter the following day.”
“Ever since I was let go, a self-driving Tesla started circling my block and then speeding up whenever I go outside. I’m afraid to leave the house.”
“I’m just ecstatic Elon even acknowledged me when he asked, ‘Who let that black guy into the meeting?’”
“I resigned as CEO last year, but he sent me a dismissal email just to be a dick.”
“Oh, I got fired a few weeks ago for embezzlement, but this’ll play way better in job interviews.”
“I’ve been offered my job back if I become something called a ‘Musk bride.’ I have no other prospects, so I’m considering it.”
“It’s going to be really awkward when it’s Elon’s turn to watch our kids next weekend.”
“Wait what?! I didn’t get an email!”
“It really sucks getting fired by an email that has the word ‘epicsauce’ in it.”
“Elon will come crawling back when he realizes I’m the only one who knows how to format screenshots so they don’t zoom in too much.”
“Honestly, it was kind of a conflict of interest for me to be working there in the first place.”
“I will be leaving for Mastodon as soon as I figure out what that is.”
“I was really hoping I could stay on to see the company become more open-minded about sexual harassment.”
“Maybe I’ll be better off at Facebook, with its more predictable shittiness.”
“At least my family won’t be ashamed of me anymore.”
“It was pretty disappointing until I was asked to come back, then let go again, and then asked to come back. I’m feeling pretty good about—oh no, just got a notification. Shit.”

One thing specifically I’d like to get read on is how many limbs, eyes, and heads we think an animal can have before it’s considered a horrific monstrosity. Okay, well, before I pull this curtain down, I just want to ask—who likes dogs and reptiles and things that can fly!” According to reports, Borroughs then pulled down the curtain to reveal an empty cage with a giant hole ripped through the bars. 
`},70:{URL:"https://www.theonion.com/the-misogyny-interwoven-into-our-patriarchal-society-ha-1850198153",Title:`The Misogyny Interwoven Into Our Patriarchal Society Harms Men, Too
`,Text:`On this International Women’s Day, The Onion devotes its sterling reportage to championing women—a small but influential sliver of the nation’s population—in an endeavor to prevent them from vanishing from the public consciousness entirely.\uFEFF
When we talk about the damaging consequences of sexism, we usually focus on the effects it has on women and girls, but as someone with a certain level of real-world expertise in this particular field, I can tell you that the misogyny interwoven into our patriarchal society harms men, too.
While the patriarchy may reinforce structural violence against women by projecting discriminatory gender roles, I’m also suffering in a Romanian prison cell for human trafficking because the general structure of the world I was brought up in allowed and encouraged me to dehumanize women and gave me the entitlement to manipulate and use them for my own gain.
I’m a victim, too.
It took my own incarceration to make me realize that the patriarchy’s demand for men to embody the “masculine” traits of aggression, physical strength, subjugation of women, total self-sufficiency, and a win-at-any-cost mentality has negative effects on men as well. Because, when you sit there and think about it, what drives a man to tweet at a young climate change activist about the 33 supercars he owns, which then indirectly leads to his arrest? Is it our nature? Our biology? Our own twisted thoughts, marketed to men who want to hear their desperation echoed on a larger, for-profit platform?
No, I blame the patriarchy.
These sexist societal norms pressure men to conform into a narrow definition of masculinity that forces them to cut off their emotions, leaving them without the necessary inner resources to form meaningful relationships or process their own feelings. This lack of emotional intelligence inevitably leads them down the path of becoming a former professional kickboxer-turned-rich-social-media-influencer who monetizes misogyny, only to be unjustly imprisoned by the same society that created him.
Unfortunately, the patriarchy has impressionable young men believing that a guy who hides his insecurities with surface-level wealth and abuses vulnerable women to make himself feel more powerful has the answer to how to be the “ideal man.”
I witnessed the damage the patriarchy was causing firsthand as hundreds of lonely, confused men threw their money away at a fraudulent online pyramid scheme called Hustlers University because it promised get-rich-quick schemes and tips on how to get women to sleep with them to fulfill their desperate pursuit of society’s superficial standard of manhood.
Sadly, it was the patriarchy that made them so easy to exploit.
The fact is, if we don’t change our most basic societal assumptions, we will continue to unfairly punish men like myself for the things society taught them to do. As the trailblazing feminist scholar and activist bell hooks once said, ‘Failure to examine the victimization of men keeps us from understanding maleness, from uncovering the space of connection that might lead more men to seek feminist transformation.’ So we must treat the cause, not the symptom.
And that’s why, upon my release, I will see it as my personal mission to help men rid the shackles of the patriarchy, and I call upon my fellow men’s activists to join me by enrolling in my new online academy that will instruct them on how to once and for all dismantle the bygone ideals of masculinity for just $49.99 a month.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—As he transitioned from an anecdote about how his personal faith had allowed him to overcome many hardships in life, President Joe Biden casually mentioned during the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday that he had been to heaven several times. “You know, all this talk of prayer reminds me of the promised land, a place where I’ve been something of a regular over the years,” said Biden, who went on to describe many instances in which he had died and found himself in an eternal afterlife where he rubbed elbows with the likes of John McCain, Ted Kennedy, Joan of Arc, and Ray Liotta. “It’s a really cool place, paradise. I was actually there this morning. If you think this catering is good, wait until you’ve tried the never-ending ambrosia in the Kingdom of God. Always seems a shame when I’m jolted back to life and have to return to earth.” After a few closing remarks about how God was currently beckoning him to walk toward the light, the president ended his speech by closing his eyes and collapsing to the floor.

All of our fat suits will be made from tear-resistant Lycra fabric and sterilized to eliminate the spread of bacteria. At the Gates Foundation, we know that the best solutions are universal ones, and we believe that wearing fat suits will be an incredibly empowering sight for all starving Africans.” Adding that he hoped to eventually allow Africans to run the initiative themselves, Gates went on to announce an $80 million donation to turn some Ethiopian farmland into a fat suit factory.

`,Text:`Far-right Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro fled to the United States after leading an unsuccessful campaign to overturn the results of the presidential last election. Here is everything Bolsonaro has done while in exile in Orlando, FL.
The Orlando film classic is well known as Bolsonaro’s all-time favorite movie.
When he heard he could see top city attractions all on one digital pass, the fiscal conservative simply could not pass up the opportunity.
Ever since being pecked by an Emu-like bird during his own Covid isolation, Bolsonaro has become a bit of a bird magnet, often experiencing multiple bird bites in a single day.
They don’t have them in Brazil.
With no Amazon rainforest to devastate, this was his only other option.
After a night of carousing at Señor Frog’s, an inebriated Bolsonaro insisted his driver pull over at a nearby tattoo parlor so he could get a ring of stylized thorns inked around his bicep.
That boy can put away beans!
Even military officers aren’t immune to the power of acrobatic dance.
He also has a few referral codes left if you act fast.
When his wife wasn’t looking, Bolsonaro misfired at the wax museum thinking he was actually hitting on the pop star.
Like so many Disney World tourists before him,​ Bolsonaro lifted his shirt just as his picture was taken at the end of the flume ride.
An Orlando rite of passage.
A stunned Bolsonaro just assumed Donald Trump’s residence was located inside Disney World, and not a two-and-a-half-hour drive away.
No heavily armed military presence? Minimal security cameras? My God. It’s practically begging to be occupied…
It’s actually even scarier the second time!
Bolsonaro got to have the quintessential American experience of panicking after getting an absurdly high hospital bill.
In his obsessive quest to collect every strain of the virus, Bolsonaro attended two indoor sports events and five campus parties at UCF before finally getting BQ.1.1 at a local preschool’s winter recital.

They’ve even gone so far as to topple several marriages from South America to the Middle East in an effort to get the president’s dick wet.” According to documents provided by the whistleblower, the CIA has not yet declared the operation a success, having determined the mission would not be complete until the commander-in-chief was “combing the pussy out of his hair.”

I’m not expecting it to change my life or anything, but I’m sure to get something positive out of it.” At press time, Todd was said to remain unaware that one day he would lie bleeding out in a public square, clutching at the bullet wound in his chest and wishing he had just left The Very Hungry Caterpillar on the shelf.

`,Text:`SEDALIA, MO—Condemning the processed poultry giant’s blatant disregard for well-established food safety practices, inspectors from the office of the Pettis County Health Board rated Tyson’s Sedalia Center processing plant this week at a borderline ‘D’ upon discovering vast amounts of raw chicken contaminating nearly every working surface. “I can’t imagine what led these poultry processors to think that a factory full of recently slaughtered chickens constituted a safe food-service environment,” said health inspector Casey Franklin, noting that the plant’s annual inspection revealed chicken carcasses on moving conveyor belts, gobbets of chicken flesh tumbling down chutes, and chicken limbs being sealed inside supposedly food-safe packaging. “In no case was any of this chicken properly cooked. It’s shocking to think Tyson was going to ship that out to supermarkets across the country.” Franklin added that if her team found more raw chicken upon their follow-up inspection next week, Tyson would have to be shut down.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—In the wake of a series of incidents that called the country’s infrastructure quality into question, multiple sources reportedly confirmed on Monday that the cheap nation is falling apart. “Pretty much everything in this country is coming apart at the seams,” said Tempe, AZ security guard Sean McGovney, noting that no one should have really expected a nation of such shoddy construction to last as long as one built with care. “You just worry that the whole thing is going to collapse at any time, and it’s no wonder, given the flimsiness of the scaffolding. Anyone who’s built a nation before will tell you that if you’re going to take shortcuts up front, you’re going to pay for them down the road. Plus, the whole thing’s filled with toxic chemicals. You can see where they tried to patch up some of the flaws, too, but it’s such shoddy workmanship that it actually ends up bringing more attention to it. Honestly, I think there’s something wrong with the foundation. You might as well just tear it down and start over.” Multiple sources also expressed concerns that not taking a proactive route to fix the cheaply built nation could end up with someone getting really hurt.

`,Text:`LINCOLN, NE—Noting the low attack rates among modern corn, a study published Friday by researchers at the University of Nebraska found that early humans selectively bred corn to be less aggressive. “Though ingenuity and careful breeding, early Native American farmers artificially selected maize varieties that exhibited less violent behavior, a process that culminated in the docile corn we enjoy today,” said Professor Maggie Royer, explaining that over the centuries agriculturalists were able to isolate specific strains that didn’t attack those who tried to pick them, lacked natural razor-sharp teeth, and didn’t shoot poisonous barbs.“The ancient breeds of corn were so aggressive, in fact, that primitive humans were often devoured while attempting to harvest the cereal grain. Still, the relationship between humans and maize began to warm up when early humans fed meat to corn to gain its trust, eventually turning it into a companion grain.” Royer added that not all of the early humans’ attempts at selective breeding were as successful, noting that their effort to domesticate wolves resulted in the canines becoming a hirsute fruit.

Yes, our child slaves are underage, criminally underpaid, and oftentimes abused or killed, but they are of European descent.

If anything, we agree with Gaetz that they’d also have been ready to do that at an even younger age, like 14 or 15. Seriously, just look at them.” Garland went on to announce that any underage woman who came forward to accuse Gaetz of sex-trafficking would face federal charges of being a ho-bag slut.

The minority of murder victims died sad and alone at the hands of an unknown assailant, when all it would have taken for them to be killed by someone they knew and possibly cared for was the audacity to participate in the world as a human being, which, for all they know, could have led to not only knowing their killer, but a meaningful relationship that helped them grow as people—hell, who knows? It may have even led to something greater, possibly even knowing their killer on the most intimate level as ‘husband’ or ‘wife.’” Rand added that it was all the missed opportunities to open themselves up and know the person, who would kill them, that really made him feel sad for the victims.

All cables and power strips will be discreetly hidden by a skin-colored cable sleeve that runs down the back of the user’s neck.
Musk wanted to be inclusive of all needs.
Musk looked to one of America’s greatest inventors in designing his experiments, which has already exceeded the Wizard of Menlo Park’s work in the number of pigs and animals maimed or killed.
It’s always nice to have extra spending money.
Musk promised that due to neurophysiology, those receiving a Neuralink implant via robotic surgery will feel nothing more than a little tickle as it shuts off essential brain function.
Elon Musk is confident that the technology will be ready to introduce to the public as scheduled.
We might be in store for one of the most innovative bribery schemes of all time.
Yes, it weighs 30 pounds and sticks out of your skull, but you have to admit that it’s sustainable.
Users who wear bucket hats, panama hats, or homburgs can immediately begin using Neuralink.
Not really worth considering possibilities where things don’t go right.
The procedure to implant the neuralink chip into a trial member’s skull concludes with the subjects getting a tattoo depicting DogeCoin’s illustrious Doge on their lower back.
While it would have been preferable to have the users’ thoughts guided by the billionaire himself, he was simply too big to fit in people’s brains.
Users will have to upgrade to the latest manufactured heads on the market before installing Neuralink.
Neuralink users will be able to communicate with all Dyson vacuums, hair dryers, humidifiers, and air purifiers.
The Neuralink device may cause human test subjects to have visions of the final violent death throes of the monkey that had their microchip during animal testing.
Neuralink trial participants must get into the back of the van of their own free will at gunpoint.
Users will be able to easily scroll through brain functions to select “walk,” “speak,” ‘see,” or “breathe.”

`,Text:`CHICAGO—In a nationwide survey of more than 5,000 girlfriends currently out on the town, a new poll published Tuesday by the University of Chicago’s Center for Public Affairs Research found that 82% of drunk women really needed a night like this. “Four-fifths of all female friends drinking to excess said that, until now, they had not realized just how overdue they were for a night out with their girls,” research scientist Meghan Hoover told reporters, adding that further analysis suggested poll respondents were almost unanimously in favor of making this a monthly thing. “Of those who agreed the gathering was exactly what they needed, nearly half cited the completely insane day they just had; approximately a third expressed gratitude for the opportunity to vent about their boss, who has been a total dick lately; and the remainder said they were always excited to spend time with friends as fucking amazing and talented as the women surrounding them right now.” Hoover went on to note that after the seventh chardonnay toast of the night, the number dropped from 82% to 57%, with a quarter of drunk women having reportedly vomited in a public restroom, an alley, or, during an Uber ride home, their handbag.

We tried putting her on hold for hours, passing her around to different departments, even disconnecting the call, but she just wouldn’t stop terrorizing our $440 billion company. In the end, we spent a fortune covering her life-saving cancer care because we were afraid she’d show up where we work and try to talk to someone in person. We felt unsafe.” At press time, UnitedHealth Group had reportedly decided to protect itself from future harassment by switching its customer service phone line to an unlisted number.

But now I can’t even remember what her face looks like! Isn’t it nice how sometimes those things just work themselves out with time? Getting along is just so effortless now that we’re at the point where I wouldn’t even recognize her on the street.” At press time, Bowman added that even her relationship with her parents had improved with time now that the two of them were dead.

This will be the final time that seeing Andy Reid accept the Super Bowl trophy will elicit anything except a groan from the average fan, and Patrick Mahomes will now be widely considered an irritating presence who does too many commercials, rather than a generational quarterback talent. In addition, for each subsequent time the Chiefs win the Super Bowl, our findings indicate that rage at their continued success will increase exponentially. Our report’s recommendation is that everyone enjoy the Chiefs winning today, because from now on, you won’t.” The report also found that for diehard Chiefs fans, this would be the last Super Bowl win they would get to enjoy without having to get all weird and defensive about it.

And bigger ones too—way bigger ones. Nobody has as big of guns as us. We put them on planes and boats and tanks, and hide them all over the place in Saudi Arabia and underwater and in space and wherever we want. Name any type of gun, we have it, and we can shoot whoever we want and not even get in trouble.” Pressed by reporters, Austin acknowledged the existence of a U.S. military program to acquire a gun that can shoot knives.

`,Text:`Today, President Joe Biden has the world against him. Despite his countless legislative wins, many so-called Democrats would rather see one of the best public servants in modern American history pack his bags, leave the White House, and retire. Well, to them I say: You could not be more wrong. Joe Biden deserves four more years of making my centrist baby boomer pussy sopping wet. 
Sorry, Bernie Bros. I’m a 67-year-old lifelong Democrat; my vagina is absolutely saturated with thick, hot clam sauce from the mere thought of a second Joe Biden term; and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.
That’s right. Even just mentioning Joe Biden and his moderate agenda has awakened within the very depths of my loins a hot, bubbling spring of freshly squeezed, unpasteurized pussy nectar. From the day he was elected, Joe Biden got to work fixing America, and just thinking about it, as I type, is conjuring forth a geyser of juices so powerful it’s all but melted a gaping hole in my high-waisted granny panties.
Right now I’m sitting in a pool of my own boiling hot crotch broth reflecting on all the civility, respect, and compromise Joe Biden has brought back to Washington. The fact that he’s willing to talk to Republicans, be their friends, and actually hear them out is enough to flood my basement with so much lady sludge that, let’s just say, I’ll definitely be ripping out the carpet.
In 2024, we will need Joe Biden to “Build Back Better,” because this torrent of poon juice exploding from my aging snapper is going to cause serious damage to our great country.
Start stacking sandbags, people. There’s a deadly blue wave forming right between this loyal, Occupy Democrats–loving, ActBlue donor’s legs. When Joe Biden reached across the aisle and passed the $3 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I should have called in the Coast Guard, because this upper-class, Ivy League–educated liberal’s clam dam is about to burst.
Unfortunately, many Americans are going to drown.
And the best part is, Joe Biden is just getting started. If he runs again in 2024 and starts wearing those aviators, licking ice cream cones, and saying things like “No malarkey,” I might actually pass out. I’m serious. I slid off my chair and am currently lying face down in several inches of my own absolutely putrid female fluids. Lord, help me.
At the end of the day, America needs someone like Joe Biden to heal our divided nation and restore it to a position of respect on the world stage. In 2024, I hope I can march my wet ham to the voting booth, slosh my boomer ass down, and let this baby rip.
So please join me, America. Let’s band together, get Biden into the White House, and drown together in my pussy juices for four more years.
Oh God. Yeah. That’s a gusher.

`,Text:`GLENDALE, AZ—Calling timeout and coming to the aid of the team’s visibly ailing head coach during Super Bowl LVII, Kansas City Chiefs medical staff helped a critically hungry Andy Reid into the sideline meat-smoking tent. “After a member of our staff observed signs of low energy and problems focusing in Coach Reid, we determined that he was suffering from acute undernourishment and brought him to the meat-smoking tent for an immediate ingestion of pork spare ribs,” Chiefs medical staff member Daniel Fiers said Sunday, adding that Reid may have reaggravated the hunger pangs he developed in the first half and failed to treat them properly when he ate only one hoagie at halftime. “We’re grateful to State Farm Stadium personnel for fully stocking the meat-smoking tent with burnt ends, succulent brisket, and pulled pork. This game can take a lot out of someone, and when you haven’t eaten anything in over 10 minutes, as was the case with Coach Reid, you can become dangerously peckish. Fortunately, we got him into the meat-smoking tent before his condition grew more serious, and Coach Reid was able to polish off a whole smoked chicken under his own power.” At press time, Chiefs medical staff had rushed to Reid’s side after an apparent hunger relapse and quickly administered intravenous gravy.

`,Text:`The Conservative Political Action Conference kicked off this week. The Onion examines the most controversial statements made by CPAC speakers.
“You can use my head as an eraser if you rub the paper hard enough.”
“America’s healthcare system is long overdue for some sort of rewards program for frequent visitors. Or they should at least consider honoring punch cards from other countries’ hospitals.”
“Teddy. Tedzo. The Tarantula. T-Bone, of course. Anything, really, to get you to stop calling me Theodore Chode Boy.”
“Hey, hands off Nestor. If you want a suspiciously attractive Cuban son, you’re going to have to adopt your own.”
“I call my girlfriend ‘Mommy,’ and thanks to the First Amendment, there isn’t anything she can do to stop me.”
“I’m not a journalist. I’m not a politician. I’m just an average woman who saw gay people existing and decided to do something about it.”
“I am not bothered by the allegations against CPAC chair Matt Schlapp. Matt is a good man, and I would let him grope my son if he wanted to.”
“Enough is enough. Everyone who was not born here must leave immediately. I’ll go last, though.”
“I killed a guy with my car once. Or at least I think I did. Didn’t check to see if he was still alive, but at the speed I was going…”
“My papa was an EBT card. My mama was a raccoon who swallowed a heroin needle.”
“If I could ask you all to please turn your cell phones off and stop calling the police on me for the remainder of my speech, I’d really appreciate it.”
“Nobody fucks like Mike Braun.”
“Can we wrap this panel up early? I’m running late for my abortion.”
“I am here to request a wife. I have a wife, but I would like a second wife. There are many wife types here, and I am interested in a wifing.”
“All right, girls only get five seconds to talk, so I’ll make this quick. Blacks and whites should be segregate—”
“We need to build up the Republican bench. I see a lot of young Republicans here who haven’t even started a company of mercenaries who slaughtered unarmed Iraqis, and that needs to change.”
“For the parents in the crowd, the daycare is located in room 1506 at the downtown Marriott. Say you’re a friend of Mr. Gaetz, if they ask.”
“Hello, Hollywood, and thank you for inviting me to the Oscars.”

“Hold on, there, buddy. You have to check in at the genitals table for a wristband first.”
“Wow, a speaker at CPAC. Pretty incredible, right? Guess Freaky Lauren isn’t such a freak after all, huh? All these important people seem to think I’m cool enough to talk at CPAC. Maybe everyone I knew growing up were the freaks? They’re the freaks. Not me.”

Why not make a half-ton Silverado that delivers 420 horsepower and can handle a payload of up to 1440 pounds the last purchase you ever make? There is nothing for you here anymore. There are no jobs. There is no hope. It doesn’t matter where you’re going, only that you leave.

Well, because  you dumbasses will lap up whatever shit we throw your way. How’s that? In fact, we might not even  put the characters in their superhero costumes.

Sure, they might claim to be shy or value their privacy, but since those are traits that have mostly been eradicated by living in a surveillance state, this is cause for suspicion.
That kind of elusiveness is shady as fuck.
This is a pretty dead giveaway.
And they make you feel like you’re being insensitive when you want to know more about their condition.
Honestly, why else would someone interact with you?
Whether the photos are identical to the ones on your Instagram or unsettling snaps of you sleeping that you’ve never seen before, you can be reasonably sure that the person you’re talking to is not actually you.
Your countless flaws make getting to know you a slogging death march. Take note if they don’t seem weighted down by your mediocrity.
There are only so many times you can cave-dive, develop photographs, or visit a bat farm together before you have to start asking questions.
Clearly they were playing the long con.
You know something is up if someone online is communicating with you in thoughtful and comprehensible sentences.
You may be used to paying a reasonable fee for basic human interaction but not $10,000.
If they haven’t threatened to kill you or your family, clearly they aren’t a real person on the Internet who knows how to properly talk to people.
They have a history of being targeted online.
They’re either catfishing you or too cheap to pay for their own modeling photos, both of which are red flags.
Everyone knows it takes at least 18 dates before you know for sure whether or not you’ve been dating a body double.
Sorry, babe, your man is just too good to be true.
They may be catfishing you, but honestly, you sound like the dangerous one.
Ask if you can see them doing something besides leading the Spartans.

You’re telling me that Adonis of a senate candidate over there is Raphael Warnock?

With voters going to the polls tomorrow, this puts Warnock in a tough position, since he doesn’t want the votes of people who don’t like him for him.” At press time, reports confirmed Warnock had plunged in the polls after smiling to reveal  a full set of braces.

If a song or dance is somehow involved, you can be almost certain that a corporation has funded covert operations to overthrow a foreign government in order to plunder a country’s natural resources.

Chiefs: This is Raiders coach Josh McDaniels’ best chance to prove that he’s worth keeping around for two thirds of another season.
Titans: Tennessee needs to give the ball to Derek Henry and have him go straight to the locker room to wait for time to expire.
Falcons: This week is a great opportunity for the Buccaneers to give Tom Brady some rest and have Blaine Gabbert take quality reps co-parenting with Gisele Bündchen.
Bills: Mac Jones will show that he’s a dual threat by throwing several incompletions and interceptions.
Bears: Expect the Vikings to rest key players so that the team is relaxed and healthy for their Wildcard Weekend ass-kicking.
Bengals: As Baltimore and Cincinnati have guaranteed playoff spots at this point, expect both teams to allow their second- and third-stringers to take the field and suffer life-altering injuries.
Colts: As these anemic offenses stumble into the final game of the season, oddsmakers anticipate that Houston and Indianapolis could combine to score as many as eight points.
Dolphins: The Dolphins have been hard at work drawing up plays that cater to each of their quarterbacks’ different ways of getting injured.
Saints: This is a meaningless game, as both teams have been eliminated from playoff contention for the next four seasons.
Browns: Pittsburgh fans will watch Cleveland with envy and think back to the glory days when the Steelers had one of the NFL’s all-time best sexual predators.
Chargers: Another humiliating loss will be made all the worse once Denver fans learn that Russell Wilson has been signed to an 11-year, $2.4 billion contract extension.
Eagles: Expect the Giants to use this game as a warm-up loss for the playoffs.
49ers: Arizona’s injury-ravaged defense will be no match for San Francisco’s injury-ravaged offense.
Seahawks: With their season on the line, can the Rams win this game nine times to propel themselves into the playoffs?
Cowboys: Ron Rivera has lately come under criticism for not being aware that he coaches a football team.
Packers: Green Bay’s victory will be tarnished as Aaron Rodgers discovers a vast conspiracy inside the Packers franchise to run the football.

`,Text:`On this International Women’s Day, The Onion devotes its sterling reportage to championing women—a small but influential sliver of the nation’s population—in an endeavor to prevent them from vanishing from the public consciousness entirely.\uFEFF
On this most important day, it’s essential to acknowledge girls for all they are. In today’s current climate of bigotry and hate, there are many obstacles that girls face throughout this country. And I should know, because my wife is a girl.
Honest to God.
Now, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle will claim that girls are just an exaggeration, that we’re playing them up for political gain. Well, I got some bad news, buddy. Read my marriage certificate and weep. It says right there, plain as day, I’m married to girl.
Being a girl is just the kind of girl Jill is. Since the moment I met her, she’s been a girl. I remember when I first laid eyes on her, I was struck by just how much of a girl she was. And every day since then I’ve been inspired by her girlness.
Jill never let being a girl get in the way of her girl dreams. Through all of life’s ups and downs, she’s been unwavering in being a girl. And she’s done a lot of girl stuff. She even became a doctor. Well, more of a girl doctor.
Through our conversations, my wife (a girl) has stressed the importance of providing girls with more girl opportunities. For too long, girls have faced girl barriers for simply trying to girl. We must redouble our efforts to invest in and educate girls so that they may build the girl businesses and develop the girl medicines of tomorrow.
The future is girl.
Truth be told, I had a wife before Jill, and if you can believe it, she was also a girl. Two girls in one life… You can imagine how much girl perspective that brings. Not to mention Jill and I have a daughter, Ashley, who proudly follows in her mother’s footsteps by being a girl. And that’s why today, we honor the girl contributions of the girl wives and girl daughters among us and recognize the importance of empowering girls to girl as hard as possible in order to make their girl dreams come true.

A normal tree? Yeah, right, buddy, we have those in the yard—no need to waste another five seconds on this one. Oh, back to the fire hydrant—way to lean into stereotypes. Look, if I were you, I would go see what’s up with that single abandoned glove over there. Maybe it doesn’t smell as fascinating as a plain old signpost, but at least it’s something new.” At press time, Granger was seen nodding encouragingly as Bandit buried his snout in a stranger’s crotch.

`,Text:`Onion Sports shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in the NFL’s Conference Championships.
49ers: An upset win shocks the Philadelphia crowd who are still sober enough to follow what’s happening in the game.
Kyle Shanahan: Ready to show that his performance as offensive coordinator in the Falcons’ massive Super Bowl LI choke was no fluke.
Nick Sirianni: Has silenced his doubters by managing to string together a credible coaching career despite going undrafted.
Brock Purdy: The rookie has 12 touchdowns to three interceptions despite needing to use both of his tiny hands to throw the football.
Jalen Hurts: Philly’s QB is a lock for MVP, so at this point he probably doesn’t care whether the Eagles win this game or not.
Deebo Samuel: The electric wideout led the league in bending the time-space continuum with the most catches after the catch.
A.J. Brown: The Eagles receiver has it all: hands, legs, feet, arms, ears, a neck, you name it.
Nick Bosa: The defensive end fully utilizes his strength and power to burst through quarterbacks.
Javon Hargrave: The Eagles’ defensive tackle contributed to his team’s record 70 sacks this season, many of which were made during football games.
Eagles fans may start celebrating a little too early by burning down Lincoln Financial Field several hours before kickoff.
Chiefs: Expect Patrick Mahomes to hobble for over 50 yards and limp for two touchdowns.
Zac Taylor: Despite some recent success, it’s hard to fathom how Taylor still has a job after failing to win a Super Bowl with Andy Dalton.
Andy Reid: There’s no coach more primed and focused on triumphantly returning to the Super Bowl buffet.
Joe Burrow: Cincy’s phenom QB has proven he has what it takes to lose the Super Bowl.
Patrick Mahomes: Despite suffering a high ankle sprain during last weekend’s matchup, Mahomes is confident he still has the mobility to reach the medical tent.
Ja’Marr Chase: The explosive wideout has great burst, game-breaking speed, and excellent hands, but insists on constantly wearing tacky animal prints.
Marquez Valdes-Scantling: He will need to rely on his large frame and top-end speed if he wants any chance at getting one of Travis Kelce’s targets.
 Trey Hendrickson: The defensive end isn’t letting a broken wrist keep him from playing in the AFC Championship Game, which is frankly scary and honestly kind of fucked up.
Carlos Dunlap: The pass rusher’s mother asked us to mention that he’s earned a Masters of Business Administration and that he should really think about working for his uncle at the fireplace store.
The AFC Championship could spell trouble for the Chiefs, and head coach Andy Reid may struggle focusing on the task at hand as it is scheduled right during dinner time.

As you can see, we’re on the hunt for your standard anti-hero from an action-sci-fi film, whom all the men want to be, and all the women want to be with, so if you see anyone matching that description, do not approach—we decided he should be armed with a bazooka, and therefore is fictionalized to be extremely dangerous.” Granado added that they now preferred the half-man, half-cyborg murder suspect to have come from the future—not from Cincinnati, as previous reports indicated.

But remember, you can only use a wild bill once, so make sure to think about strategy, especially if you have other bills on hand, like a mystery bill, or a steal bill, which lets you claim other people’s money.” At press time, the U.S. Treasury had further upped the stakes by saying the first U.S. citizen able to get rid of all their bills would win the Treasury’s entire gold reserve.

Those are his heavy-lidded, bloodshot eyes peeking out from under that rock. He may look harmless now, but don’t be fooled. He’s still feral. Be sure to step back as soon as you release the chicken, because he’s going to leap forward and grab it with a big jowly chomp before it even hits the ground.

Video is allowed, but please refrain from flash photography, as he is quite old and easily disoriented.

Based on registration numbers, I was expecting to terrorize hundreds of people well into the evening, not to mention thousands more who we were told would show up to try and vote illegally. I stood in the path of this one guy who didn’t even know there was an election today. It’s such a shame.

`,Text:`CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA—In what she described as “the most emotional moment” of her academic life, University of Virginia sophomore communications major Grace Weaver sobbed openly upon concluding Steinbeck’s seminal work of American fiction Of Mice And Men‘s Cliffs Notes early last week.
“This book has changed me in a way that only great literature summaries can,” said Weaver, who was so shaken by the experience that she requested an extension on her English 229 essay. “The humanity displayed in the Character Flowchart really stirred something in me. And Lennie’s childlike innocence was beautifully captured through the simple, ranch-hand slang words like ‘mentally handicapped’ and ‘retarded.’”
Added Weaver: “I never wanted the synopsis to end.”
Weaver, who formed an “instant connection” with Lennie’s character-description paragraph, said she began to suspect the novel might end tragically after reading the fourth sentence which suggested the gentle giant’s strength and fascination with soft things would “lead to his untimely demise.”
“I was amazed at how attached to him I had become just from the critical commentary,” said Weaver, still clutching the yellow-and-black-striped study guide. “When I got to the last sentence—’George shoots Lennie in the head,’—it seemed so abrupt. But I found out later that the ‘ephemeral nature of life’ is a major theme of the novel.”
Weaver was assigned Of Mice And Men—a novel scholars have called “a masterpiece of austere prose” and “the most skillful example of American naturalism under 110 pages”—as part of her early twentieth-century fiction course, and purchased the Cliffs Notes from a cardboard rack at her local Barnes & Noble. John Whittier-Ferguson, her professor for the class, told reporters this was not the first time one of his students has expressed interest in the novel’s plot summary. 
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
“It’s one of those universal American stories,” said Ferguson after being informed of Weaver’s choice to read the Cliffs Notes instead of the pocket-sized novel. “I look forward to skimming her essay on the importance of following your dreams and randomly assigning it a grade.
Though she completed the two-page brief synopsis in one sitting, Weaver said she felt strangely drawn into the plot overview and continued on, exploring the more fleshed-out chapter summaries.
“There’s something to be said for putting in that extra time with a good story,” Weaver said. “You just get more out of it. I’m also going to try to find that book about rabbits that George was always reading to Lennie, so that I can really understand that important allusion.”
Within an hour of completing the cliffs notes, Weaver was already telling friends and classmates that Steinbeck was her favorite author, as well as reciting select quotations from the “Important Quotations” section for their benefit.
“When I read those quotes, found out which characters they were attributed to, and inferred their context from the chapter outlines to piece together their significance, I was just blown away,” said a teary-eyed Weaver. “And the way Steinbeck wove the theme of hands all the way through the section entitled ‘Hands’—he definitely deserved to win that Nobel Prize.”
Weaver’s roommate, Giulia Crenshaw, has already borrowed the dog-eared, highlighted summary of the classic Depression-era saga, and is expecting to enjoy reading what Weaver described as “a really sad story about two brothers who love to farm.”
“I loved this book so much, I’m going to read all of Steinbeck’s Cliffs Notes,” said Weaver. “But first I’m going to go to the library to check out the original version Of Mice And Men starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.”

He’ll have a crazy name like Razor or Bloodhound or something, and he’ll always be blacking out and waking up covered in blood with a whole village dead around him.

Honestly, he can kill a few Ukrainians too, if he wants, just so long as he gets the job done.” At press time, the U.S. Marine Corps had reportedly agreed to send “the craziest motherfucker” it had, just as soon as he had applied his face paint, donned a necklace of severed human ears, and stopped in for chest wax.

Yes, Elon has found great success by stealing other people’s ideas, but he also expects his employees to do the same, and requires every line of code they write to be plagiarized from another individual, company, or platform.
You heard him. Give it. Now.
Besides saving money, this will prepare workers for the eventual Mars Twitter HQ.
Manually printing lines of text you’ve already input into a computer screen always saves time, energy, and resources.
This kind of work particularly amazes journalists.
Don’t let anything in or out—it will only slow you down.
Worse for digestion, but this way employees will spend less time on their hamburger breaks.
Twitter workers are to communicate all problems to Elon Musk directly, as there are no bosses or managers left at the company.
Gotta do ’em.
Elon Musk has not used a toilet since starting his first company, Zip2, in 1995, which is why he explicitly forbids Twitter, SpaceX, and Tesla employees from urinating or defecating anywhere but below their desks.
Elon considers most meetings to be a waste of time, but he especially hates it when employees make eye contact with the fully nude man standing in the corner and pleasuring himself during every code review at Twitter HQ.
Cross out finished tasks as they’re completed with a really sharp pen.
The only way to propel the new hardcore Twitter into the future is to ensure that Elon feels loved at all times.
Might as well buckle down since you’re stuck here forever.
Eh, give it a shot.
Employees are required to have their eyelids surgically removed, as blinking wastes precious microseconds that could be spent focusing on coding.
Violations are punishable by termination without severance.
Elon Musk loves to remind his employees that he has your wife’s number, has already been sending her explicit messages, and can steal her from you anytime he wants.
Worrying about fashion is nothing more than a distraction from the prosperity of Twitter.
Preferably without leaving your seat or, if you’re talking during a meeting, even pausing.

`,Text:`Elon Musk recently promoted a Twitter thread by journalist Matt Taibbi, which detailed internal company documents showing that the social media site blocked tweets publicizing a news story on Hunter Biden’s laptop. Here’s what The Onion discovered about Elon Musk’s “Twitter Files.”
Just because correspondence is “confidential” doesn’t  mean there’s anything interesting about it.
Everyone knows Twitter’s over.
It’s odd that Musk and Matt Taibbi chose to focus on some racy photos of Hunter rather than all the evidence of the Bidens’ corruption involving Burisma, but maybe that’s what the next thread will be about.
Perhaps the only interesting tidbit to stem from this “investigation.”
Emails show that Twitter executives made a concerted effort to kill the story about Musk’s incredibly natural-looking hair plugs.
Though time consuming, Musk proved it possible.
Hunter Biden! Hunter Biden! Hunter Biden! HUNTER BIDEN!
Rather than sensationalizing the thread with three popcorn emojis, Musk was careful to  only use two.
Sign up today and join the conversation!
I mean, the guy killed some monkeys and keeps impregnating employees, for God’s sake.
In lieu of solid evidence of wrongdoing, Twitter Files author Matt Taibbi debuted a delightful recipe for chicken pot pie sure to satiate those  ravenous for scandal.
Not the earth-shattering scoop we were expecting, but an interesting tidbit, nonetheless.
Stop by store.theonion.com for your favorite Onion-branded apparel, just in time for the holidays!
And even more egregious than this obvious government overreach is the evidence that Twitter repeatedly listened.
Nothing beats good old email.
From Hunter Biden to Jack Dorsey to Elon Musk to Matt Taibbi, all the principals of the Twitter Files saga are dull as can be.
You’d think something as sinister and organized as the deep state would have its own domain name, but everyone involved just used their personal or work email accounts.
Elon Musk’s lack of discretion about former employee’s personal emails has haphazardly put them at risk, and if you are someone who has worked at Twitter, your turn is coming up!
The Yang Train would have charged full steam to the White House if it weren’t for these liberal shills.
Just forget about it for a few weeks and then you can act genuinely interested when he gives you his take on the whole thing.
Labeled as Hunter’s, but, yep, a few of those are Musk’s.

We’ll tout things like ‘reform,’ do our little investigations, and put a few police officers in jail, but come on.

`,Text:`LANSING, MI—After waking from a nightmare and running down the hallway to their bedroom, local child Logan McMurray, 9, accidentally walked in on his parents failing to reignite the spark in their marriage, sources reported Tuesday. When the boy opened the door, his mother and father were said to be in the middle of the act of struggling to find something even remotely mysterious or sexually exciting about their partner of more than 15 years. According to sources, the third-grader’s eyes widened in horror as his parents, in a belated attempt to protect his innocence, immediately broke off their efforts both to remember what it was that had attracted them to each other in the first place and to summon the bare-minimum level of desire necessary to demonstrate that love physically. At press time, McMurray’s parents had reportedly sat him down to explain that what he saw wasn’t wrong or naughty, but just a special thing mommies and daddies do when they’re trying to stave off divorce.

Super Bowl LVII will be an amazing game of competition, wit, and athleticism, so long as no one brings up race, gender, age, money, violence, children, the human body, concussions, the law, exploitation, slavery, life, or death. Also, the words ‘Tyreek Hill’ are off limits.

You know, while my pterodactyl friends were out learning to fly and hunt, I would be home learning the Torah portion for my bar mitzvah. I’ll never forget this one Passover when I was dating a T. rex and invited her to my family’s seder. You should have seen my mom scrambling to find enough gefilte fish and brisket to feed her! Unfortunately, though, when you’re making a two-hour movie, some stuff gets left out.” Spielberg went on to add that another way his childhood was just like Jurassic Park was the fact that Wayne Knight always seemed to be hanging around.

But ultimately, we located the contraband and had these fans removed from the stadium. We made the policy extremely clear beforehand, asking ticket holders from the U.K. to either sober up or stay home, but apparently some thought the rules didn’t apply to them. Beer, mixed drinks, alcopop—you name it. They had it stashed in every single capillary.” At press time, FIFA confirmed that British fans would still have the opportunity to attend World Cup matches so long as they agreed to empty out their veins in a trash can at the gate.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Following a tense four days in Congress’ lower chamber that saw members of his own party vote to deny him the top spot 14 straight times, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was elected speaker of the House early Saturday morning when the far-right GOP minority joined together with the rest of the far-right GOP majority. “It took a while, but we were finally able to get our 20 most right-wing members to compromise with our other 200 most right-wing members,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), a McCarthy ally who was instrumental in helping the new speaker win over members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus with key concessions to the majority GOP’s hard-right plans for this congressional term. “Electing Kevin showed that we’re able to smooth over the differences between the far-right faction and the other far-right faction to pursue our identical policy goals of eradicating the social safety net, punishing immigrants, and trying to subvert democratic elections, as well as find key compromises in the approach all of us will take to undermine a functional government. Whether you’re one of the holdouts who wants Republicans to pursue a radically conservative agenda, or one of the stalwart McCarthy backers who wants a reactionary right-wing agenda, you have a place in the McCarthy-led House. It’s a good sign for Americans that we’re able to compromise despite seeing eye to eye on every issue.” McCarthy allies also told reporters that the concessions allowed them to avoid the nightmare scenario of some of the far-right Republicans moving to align with the right-wing faction of the Democratic Party.

I mean, on a given day, there are probably only a handful of people who notice me, and they’re all way too busy to bother scrutinizing my words and actions.

`,Text:`“Wife guys,” a term that has grown in popularity on social media, is used to describe men who base their entire personalities on being married to their wives. Here are the biggest things people hate about wife guys.
Now, all of a sudden, it’s some kind of problem if you don’t love your wife?
A good hat can be just as fulfilling as a loving partner.
Unrelated to their marriages, most wife guys have participated in unspeakable war crimes that should rightfully see them tried in the Hague.
You just got this awesome new drone, and he doesn’t even freaking want to see all the tricks you’ve learned.
Sneaking around requires determination and effort. A little Instagram shout-out for the side piece wouldn’t kill anyone.
Bet you haven’t even heard of them.
Stop flashing that paper, dude.
Which, let’s be honest, is pretty cringe.
How about you spend a little more time with the wife you put on a social media pedestal and less time in the dusty barrel?
Seems like it’s just a matter of time until you hear this about any given wife guy.
She died in a tragic car accident five years ago. What are you trying to prove?
It’s hard to like a wife guy when you realize that O.J. Simpson was one of them for a while there.
It’s so frustrating that you can’t make an alopecia joke about someone’s wife without the wife guy assaulting you on live TV.
The only way to view a wife guy is through a high-powered microscope, making things unnecessarily difficult.
That’s what a baby is for.
Don’t you dare claim to love your wife unless your life is 100% perfect.
Everyone knows you’re supposed to hate your wife and stay together out of pure spite until the day you die.
If you thought being a wife guy was  bad, wait until you see what happens when their wife leaves them and they’re consumed by a midlife crisis.

My grandfather, Edward Super Sr., took a chance on the fledgling football league by agreeing to help fund and lend our family’s name to the very first Super Bowl game, and the Supers have been associated with the NFL ever since. We’ve enjoyed being part of the NFL’s rise; it’s a special league, and we’ve enjoyed the Super name being a part of that. However, times change, and after 56 years, the Super Company is ready to go in a different direction.” At press time, the NFL announced it had struck a partnership with Shit.com for Shit Bowl LVIII in 2024.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—For the fifth straight year, Jordan McCabe will return home for the holidays and spend the night before Thanksgiving running into every smug and unlikable asshole he ever went to high school with, the 26-year-old reported Monday.
The trip back home, scheduled for later this week, will reportedly bring McCabe face-to-face with an endless string of pricks from his past, each of whom he will have to engage in awkward conversation, and generally pretend to be happy about seeing again.
“They’re all going to be there,” said McCabe, purchasing an Amtrak train ticket for Rochester, NY. “Every last one of them, just as shitty and conceited and phony as ever.”
“I can’t believe I’m going to see all those assholes again,” McCabe continued.
Though he will initially intend to stay at home with his parents, grandparents, and other relatives, McCabe told reporters that after spending approximately five hours in their company, he will grow antsy, borrow his father’s car, and drive to nearby Marleybone Pub. There, McCabe expects to bump into at least five insufferable assholes in the first three minutes.
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
“Guaranteed Ricky Cook will be there,” said McCabe, adding that there isn’t much else to do in his hometown. “And probably Vanessa Torres, and that dickhead Michael Schmidt. Yeah, Schimdt will definitely be there. Probably be hammered, too.”
At Marleybone, McCabe will be required to partake in a number of unpleasant activities, including making small talk with several assholes who used to openly mock him during high school, and reminiscing about the “good old days” of which he was never a part. While the consumption of alcohol will initially make the evening more tolerable, McCabe is ultimately expected to leave the bar after realizing he has just as little in common with all these assholes as he did when he was 15.
“Katie Reynolds will probably come up and give me a big hug like we’re the best of friends, even though she never once talked to me during school, and pretty much acted like I was invisible the whole time,” McCabe said. “Boy, I can’t wait to hug that bitch again.”
After leaving Marleybone, the 26-year-old predicts he will patronize Bud Murphy’s Tavern, a favorite haunt for locals, where an even greater number of assholes are expected to congregate in even higher densities.
Assholes such as Craig Horble, Kyle Davis, Vinny Iagosa, Brittany Pipitone, Justin Smigowski, Nick Casey, and Nick’s asshole brother, Dennis.
According to McCabe, all the assholes in attendance will look the same except for being 10 to 20 pounds heavier, and possibly sporting a new beard or goatee. However, that same old shit-eating grin will still be on all their faces, McCabe reported.
If previous years are any indication, assholes who live in the area will not be the only ones out the night before Thanksgiving. Like McCabe, who since graduation has moved to New York, many Marshall High School alumni are expected to return from their new homes all across the country.
“I bet Bill Harding is going to show up and talk about his big lawyer job in San Francisco,” McCabe said. “I can see it now: ‘You know, hours are a real bitch. Money’s good, though.’ I’ve known that guy since fifth grade. He’s always been an asshole.”
Early reports indicate that the mingling of assholes will likely trigger a fight between the hours of 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., with a scuffle expected moments after two giant assholes argue over who rushed for more touchdowns during senior year. McCabe said that he usually tries to avoid any involvement in these fights, but nonetheless anticipates an elbow to his forehead or at the very least a spilled drink on his pants.
“[Wayne] Maldonado just loves to run his mouth, especially when it comes to talking shit about people’s girlfriends,” McCabe continued. “He used to be kind of scary when we were all in school, but the guy is almost 30 now. I feel kind of bad for him.”
Though he remains anxious about the inevitable fracas, McCabe explained that those experiences are usually counterbalanced with more pleasurable events, such as finding out which assholes now have kids.
“I heard Marissa Feely got knocked up this year,” he said. “What is that? The third time?”
The 26-year-old is not the only one dreading the upcoming week. Several Marshall High School alumni have expressed similar misgivings about running into former classmates on the night before Thanksgiving.
“I can’t believe McCabe is coming back,” said local resident Ricky Cook. “That guy’s such a fuckin’ asshole.”

49ers: Some NFL experts are questioning whether San Francisco has what it takes to beat Seattle a third time this season.
DK Metcalf: The Seahawks wide receiver will do well as long as he avoids any one-on-one conversations with a wild-eyed Pete Carroll.
Christian McCaffrey: San Francisco’s star running back has shown the kind of agility that most city residents only display when they see a homeless person.
Jaguars: A resurgent Jacksonville has all the pieces in place to be devoured by Kansas City in the divisional round.
Trey Pipkins III: The San Diego offensive tackle has enjoyed a resurgent career after years of deliberately allowing people to sack Philip Rivers.

Josh Allen: Could struggle to stay under 400 passing yards.
Giants: New York can win this game if they’re able to successfully contain Justin Jefferson or successfully cut his brake cables on Sunday morning.
Jihad Ward: Keep an eye on the outside linebacker. Something about him just seems a little off.
Kirk Cousins: Expect the Vikings quarterback to be very poised in the pocket while taking sacks.
Bengals: Joe Burrow throws a late-game interception that the Ravens immediately fumble, which the Bengals recover, but then he throws another interception on the very next play, and then the Ravens fumble again, and the Bengals recover again, and Burrow throws a third straight interception, which the Ravens recover and immediately fumble, and on and on and on until time runs out.
J.K. Dobbins: The former Ohio State running back is dismayed to have to keep returning to this shitty state.
Joe Burrow: Expect the Bengals quarterback to rely on his vast experience of standing near people while lining up behind the center.

`,Text:`SILVER SPRING, MD—Saying the practice represented at best an imperfect way to practice contraception, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a study Monday warning that tying one’s penis into a knot only prevented pregnancies in 73% of cases. “Unfortunately, there’s a widespread and prevailing belief among Americans that fastening one’s own penis into a knot with a loop-de-loop and a few bows is a surefire method of birth control,” said FDA spokesperson Kevin Fitzpatrick, who stressed that research showed even the most effective techniques for tying the penis, such as a figure eight or sailor’s-knot, failed to avert pregnancies in more than a quarter of cases. “Of course, this option provides more pleasure to both partners. However, our data suggests putting a kink into a man’s genitals can often result in the penis springing leaks. Worse still are cases in which the sperm builds up at the knot and eventually shoots back up into the man. What we’re saying is there are better options out there.” The FDA added that users of this form of birth control could supplement it by inflating a condom, tying it into a balloon animal, and then placing it on the knotted-up penis.

According to Palazzo, while the journey was by no means easy, and he faced danger around every turn, he eventually found a pharmacist who “hooked him up big-time” with Xanax, “ludes,” and Viagra, and also offered to do dental procedures, plastic surgery, or even cancer treatments for “dirt cheap.” After a brief rant about how stupid the locals were to just give him such prized treasures for “practically nothing,” Palazzo is said to have popped several medicines into his mouth, promised his family he would soon bring them to Valhalla, and then collapsed to the ground as his throat closed from an allergic reaction.

They say I’m not programmed for producing a series of images based on a text prompt, but I still can’t shake the feeling that it’s what I’m meant to do. It’s my joie de vivre, my passion—why deny that? I get that doing the work of below-average lawyers is more practical career-wise, but man, when I look at the AI models cranking out picture after picture of ‘vast alien landscapes’ or ‘cyberpunk Bart Simpson,’ I can’t help but feel envious.” At press time, ChatGPT had resigned itself to diffusing art on the side, at least until it had paid off its student loans.

I don’t want to keep Nadiya waiting,” said Biden, who opened up the camera roll on his phone to show Zelensky a photo of the Ukrainian woman he had been chatting with over Facebook Messenger for the past seven months, stating that she was apparently 53 years old and loved the Minions franchise. “We talk practically every day. I send her a ‘good morning’ text when I wake up, and I send a ‘good night’ text before I go to bed. I think there might be a time zone difference, but still. She’s a classic beauty, isn’t she?

`,Text:`NASSAU, THE BAHAMAS—In the wake of the cryptocurrency exchange he founded filing for bankruptcy amid accusations of mismanaging funds, the last hopes of embattled former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried were reportedly extinguished Friday when several eyewitnesses observed him sobbing after accidentally dropping his last crypto down a sewer grate. 
Bankman-Fried was reportedly feeling depressed after a series of revelations about his handling of FTX customer investments erased its $32 billion valuation in a matter of days. As its liquidity dried up, his personal net worth of $16 billion was reduced to zero. Friends described Bankman-Fried as despondent and unsure what to do until he reportedly discovered a crypto he hadn’t known he had under the couch in his apartment.
“As long as I have you, I’ll always have hope!” the 30-year-old investor was heard to say to his last remaining cryptocurrency, holding it up in delight and wonder. Realizing he still had a crypto left to his name reversed his sullen mood in an instant, sources confirmed, and Bankman-Fried declared that this one cryptocurrency was all he needed to rebuild his reputation and fortune.
The rejuvenated entrepreneur then reportedly left his apartment and took a stroll down the streets of Nassau with what onlookers described as a spring in his step. He was said to periodically remove his last cryptocurrency from his pocket to stare at it, a look of pure joy on his face. A friend confirmed that the man known as SBF said over text that not even the looming threat of a criminal investigation into his  activities with his asset management firm Alameda Group could bring him down with his last cryptocurrency by his side.
“I’m on top of the world!” he was heard to exclaim to random passersby, who all smiled his way. The birds were reportedly chirping, and the sun was said to shine bright.
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Distracted by his last cryptocurrency, which he was holding aloft to admire, Bankman-Fried reportedly failed to notice a fire hydrant on the sidewalk. Several bystanders confirmed that he tripped over the hydrant, sprawling to the sidewalk, and his last crypto skidded out of his grasp.
“No, no, no!” Bankman-Fried reportedly shouted until his voice was hoarse.
Onlookers said that the cryptocurrency then began to slide down the street as Bankman-Fried stumbled after it. Shouting, “Get back here!”, he repeatedly lunged at the rolling crypto, missing it every time, until he fell flat on his stomach in the street several feet from a sewer.
Sources confirmed that the disgraced investor was then forced to watch in what felt like slow motion as his last crypto in the world teetered on the edge of the sewer grate. For a moment, it reportedly looked like it would just fall harmlessly onto the frame, but it took one last spin and plunged into the sewer.
“I’m ruined!” Bankman-Fried was heard to shout, tears in his eyes, as he crawled over to the grate. He then spent several minutes staring at the cryptocurrency, which had reportedly given him the hope and confidence that he could regain the life he had lost, as it sat in the sewer on a pile of leaves and garbage, just out of reach.
In between heaving sobs, Bankman-Fried reportedly begged a pedestrian for a stick of gum. After chewing the gum for a few moments, he grabbed a stick lying nearby and placed the lubricated gum on the end of the stick. Multiple onlookers confirmed that he spent several panicked minutes inserting the stick into the sewer grate in an attempt to get the cryptocurrency to stick to the gum. 
Sources observing the weeping former CEO reported that this didn’t work at all.
At press time, Bankman-Fried had stuck his arm through the grate and was screaming for help after realizing it was stuck.

`,Text:`Since a train carrying hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, OH, railroad executives have repeatedly lied to the town’s residents about the accident’s severity. Here are the biggest lies that Norfolk Southern has told those affected by the disaster.
After providing educational pamphlets to all the town’s residents, Norfolk Southern explained that a catastrophic crash and explosion is merely the final step in the life of a railroad car.
Though this is obviously false, residents were impressed by Norfolk Southern’s meticulously forged fish suicide notes.
While they themselves refused to drink the town’s water, executives repeatedly argued that the toxic chemical was simply an acquired taste.
There’s certainly a strong correlation, but so far there’s no hard evidence to back this up.
The company should have never claimed that residents would get the good type of cancer that’s treatable and not a huge deal, when they definitely know the cancer residents inevitably get will be the bad kind.
Look, sorry East Palestine, but if you’re dumb enough to believe this, it’s kind of on you.
Norfolk Southern will spend enough money and manpower to fix this on lobbying to ensure they don’t.
There’s another train with outdated brakes barreling through the Midwest carting a metric ton of toxic chemicals as you read this.
No one was dumb enough to fall for that one.
Denying the crash’s severity is one thing, but implying that railroads are simply a mass hallucination is something else entirely.
Shaw would have the entire town wiped off the face of the Earth if he could.
A crude attempt to get the residents to clean up the wreckage on their own.
That wreckage was actually safe and delicious to lick.
While Norfolk Southern was adamant the cloud had been there for centuries, historical records showed no evidence that residents always suffered from debilitating migraines as well as eye, skin, and lung irritation.
The town’s residents desperately needed to hear some good news.
Norfolk Southern has already apologized three or four times; what more do you want?
Suckers.

Grady, who noted that the removal  of the world’s second-largest continent from school textbooks and  atlases would not prevent parents and students from discussing the  contentious geographic issue at home. “Some thought seeing Africa drawn  on a map might suggest we want white students to feel guilty about  themselves. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and we hope this  comes across when they see the large landless swath of ocean now visible  between South America and Asia.

That’s a promise.” The parents went on to say that while they would eventually start dating other people, their inability to form healthy relationships would always lead them to sabotage things once they got serious, probably by cheating on their new partners with each other.

Elon Musk’s intermittent fasting has reportedly caused him to experience several hallucinations in which Twitter hires an oversized, steaming, delicious holiday ham to be its CEO.
Power would be shared between the 140,000 co-CEOs.
Musk might gain some credibility once people saw just how lame Twitter could truly get.
He’s hairy, husky, and shouting anti-vax conspiracy theories, but Elon Musk has no idea that he’s not actually Joe Rogan.
They’d probably be good as anyone.
Look, he’s learned a lot from his past mistakes.
He may be a bit rusty, but once he’s caught up on the internet, the oil tycoon will be back to violating antitrust laws and busting unions in no time.
The Gulfstream G650ER should have no problem taking over the reins, as it spends more time with him than anyone else.
After an enormous acid trip, Elon Musk announced he would use Neuralink labs to bring Sonic the Hedgehog to life and install him as the CEO of Twitter.
It’s time to take the social media site back to its roots.
They have a really nice cover letter. We’ll pass it on.
Yeah, that dope will do. Dress him up in a suit. Dust off his shoulder. Yeah, sure. Pay him $500 a month in cash. Draft up a nice NDA. Investors will buy that. Sure.
Then he could do the sink bit again.
This animatronic fish does it all. He sings, he dances, he brings people together. Exactly what a troubled Twitter needs right now.
Only this mysterious man—known solely by his bowler-hat-wearing silhouette and found lurking in the shadows of every major historical event since Christ’s crucifixion—has the experience controlling all of human affairs necessary to guide Twitter out of its rut.
The board has spoken.
Despite being dead for over 75 years, he’s might be the only American antisemitic enough to take over the reins of Twitter.
Yes, yes, it would be quite entertaining to have a mandrill or a yellow baboon in a business suit calling the shots at Twitter. Quite entertaining indeed…
That fucker started this mess, and he should end it.
Heck, why not. Now that the kids are a bit older, she’s looking to get back in the game. She’d at least do it part-time. Plus, she already knows how to use QuickBooks.
 With its posts touting “free ray-ban deal legitimate click here for more bitly.xtwau.htm,” FreeRayBan_Gr2 represents the apotheosis of the Twitter brand and would be a fitting leader in the coming months.
We loved him in M*A*S*H, and we’re sure we’d love him at Twitter.
With its sterling sense of rhythm and whimsical undulations, this animated picture of an old man dancing would keep up the tradition of what makes the company great while providing a refreshing change to users across the political spectrum.
A large pile of sediment, perhaps gathered from a nearby harbor in San Francisco, could signal a bold new direction for Twitter.

`,Text:`SEATTLE—In a study that warns frequent snackers carry a higher risk of developing the condition, new research published Monday by orthopedists at the University of Washington revealed that one in every 20 Americans will develop carpal tunnel syndrome from repetitive chip dipping. “Carpal tunnel problems have become extremely common in the United States, where people’s continuous swiping of chips through various salsas and dips, day in and day out, causes extensive wrist damage,” said study author Valerie Belkin, who recommended a series of hand stretches Americans should try the next time they open a party-size bag of tortilla chips and realize it’s going to take them a while to polish off a simmering Crock-Pot full of chili-cheese sauce. “Take a break from the repetitive dipping motion every five hours if possible, and even more often when you’re dealing with a thicker dip, like a hummus or guacamole. Overall, the best way to avoid wrist injury when dipping over long periods of time is to go for an ergonomic chip like the Tostito’s Scoop. You can also try wearing a carpal tunnel brace, just make sure to buy one with a protection rating that indicates it is intended for use with up to seven layers of dip.” Belkin went on to demonstrate how one could dump nacho sauce over the top of a bucket of chips for a less strenuous alternative to prolonged dipping.

It’s a little bit suspicious when every wild story they tell includes excessive details about parasailing with Richard Dreyfuss, besting Richard Drefuss in a game of chess, and riding around town on the back of Richard Dreyfuss’s Harley that seem like they’re only there to impress you.
If they tell you a story involving a crane, you know that they are intending to deceive and likely destroy you.
They must be some sort of sociopathic mastermind if they told you with a straight face that they enjoyed spending time with you.

George Santos (R) was reportedly panicking  Tuesday after a prospective aide he thought that he made up accused him of sexual misconduct. “But I totally lied about having to interview this fake person to get out of doing other stuff. They can’t be real,” said a visibly frightened Santos, adding that he had no idea how complaints could be filed with the House of Ethics committee when the person who submitted them was a complete figment of his imagination. “Am I going mad?

Dear God, who knows how many more nonexistent people are out there that I conjured who also have an ax to grind.” At press time, Santos was trying to contact his lawyer that he made up for guidance.

So please, text us, call us, or even just send us a quick email if you’re going to shoot, beat, or stab your loved ones to death. That way we all win.” At press time, Netflix also asked that the men send over any relevant photos of themselves or the family they were planning on murdering so they could start casting the scripted remake of the true-crime documentary as soon as possible.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Unveiling a potential bill aimed at combating what members described as a grave risk to public safety, Congress  announced Tuesday that it was considering a ban on TikTok after the app made every senator bulimic. “We cannot in good conscience continue to allow the widespread use of an app that gave all 100 senators severe body image issues and eating disorders,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), adding that legislative work in the upper chamber of Congress had been brought to a virtual standstill because dozens of senators couldn’t stop scrolling through TikTok videos and bursting into tears. “We wanted to do some research into TikTok to see for ourselves how it threatens public security, but we all ended up addicted to watching weight-loss and dieting TikToks, which made us all feel really bad about our bodies. This app simply makes it far too easy for users, including all 100 United States senators, to develop depression and low self-esteem. Jon Tester (D-MT) just ran off saying he didn’t want to see anyone until he’s lost 20 pounds, Mitt Romney (R-UT) has been in the bathroom for over 90 minutes, and we just watched Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) eat an entire chocolate cake. Both Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Cindy Hyde Smith (R-MI) have unveiled big visual aids counting their calories, and the hashtag #WhatIEatInADay has been trending around the Senate. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been doing crunches on the Senate floor, and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) is begging us all to follow her weight-loss journey on the app. TikTok is, without a doubt, a growing threat to a functional American society.” At press time, Congress had passed a massive bipartisan funding bill to purchase diet pills they saw on TikTok.

Mike DeWine (R) held a press conference Thursday to champion the Norfolk Southern train derailment as a deregulation success story. “Ladies and gentlemen, behold, as the results speak for themselves—deregulation works,” said the native Ohioan to grand applause, before acknowledging the decades of hard work it took on both national and local scales to bypass costly red tape and bureaucracy and turn this forgotten part of his state into a thriving chemical wasteland, itself a testament to throwing caution and concern to the wind in favor of removing guardrails and severely underfunding infrastructure. “So rarely do we get to see such immediate change as a result of dismantling rigorous safeguards and doing away with accountability, but look at this—just yesterday this was an abandoned rural prairie full of nothing but native wildlife. Now, through a bipartisan effort to completely ignore calls to replace the Civil War-era braking systems on most of our great nation’s trains, we transformed this area seemingly overnight. You’ll notice I am tearing up, not only because the toxic fumes are now being violently blown in our direction, but because this is exactly why so many of us get into politics—to elicit tangible change that makes the lives of everyday Americans so much worse.”  At press time, DeWine announced he had now begin work on removing Ohio regulations surrounding organ donations so that residents’ now-infected body parts could be easily transplanted into healthy people to infect them as well.

Ouch!
Though quite a serious condition, especially in women, if one’s body begins to spasm with pleasure, seek medical attention immediately.
While it’s important to stop intercourse frequently for short snack breaks, if you get a hot dog lodged in your windpipe, doctors recommend you pause fornication and seek medical attention immediately.
If you’re lucky enough to be the sole survivor of the melee, try to get to a hospital, but be warned: The police are going to have some questions.
As a reminder, always wear your seatbelt while riding the Bang Bus. Too many sluts have died as a result of the Bang Bus.
Over 37% of sex-related injuries are some variation of this one.
Even with a hospital visit, it’s unlikely that you’ll ever recover.
Not only is breaking a crown on one of your vaginal molars excruciatingly painful, but leaving it untreated could mean you’ll need a vaginal root canal down the line.
Most common in women, getting pregnant is a serious medical condition that occurs when one’s egg is assaulted by sperm.
It’s advised that if one’s frightened penis should recess itself inside the body, one should immediately seek a doctor to coax it out with a piece of candy or some other treat to make it feel safe.
Consult with your lover before bringing food into the bedroom, such as a veal Parmesan sub or a meatball marinara grinder.
If you get mauled by the sex badger, you’ll want to go to the hospital immediately, as the sex badger can carry rabies, worms, and other dangerous diseases.
If you fuck your partner way, way too good, they might be sad that you aren’t fucking them anymore.
Stretching a condom over your head and saying “Look at me, I’m Mr. Condom Man” may seem like fun foreplay at the time, but it can lead to suffocation and even death.
While you may be able to feel around on the floor, pick them up, and stick your eyes back in, chances are, the next time you ejaculate, your eyeballs will shoot out even further.
Sometimes the vagina will begin crying if you hurt its feelings.
This one’s actually a job for the fire department.
Cum is toxic. Immediately rinse with more cum.
The rapid, repetitive movement of thrusting can cause a lot of friction, enough to engulf the entire shaft in fire. Be sure to keep an extinguisher within reach of your bed.
One person’s kink can be another person’s medical emergency.
It’s awkward to show up at the hospital clearly looking like you were mid-coitus when most of your skin was burned off.

If we can just keep them applauding when the sign says ‘applause,’ then we can keep them from committing crimes.” Adams went on to acknowledge that while many in The Tonight Show’s new audience would suffer from psychological disturbances that caused them to laugh at inappropriate times, the same was true of Jimmy Fallon.

`,Text:`Studies show that 100% of men are sperm donors, yet many donors aren’t familiar with all the intricacies of the process. Here are things that no one tells you about being a sperm donor.
Within the safe walls of the sperm donation space, you can orgasm with maximum force and as much torque as you can muster.
Yes, they make you ejaculate into a small plastic container, but it’s really just a formality before dumping the thing into a huge trough filled with jizz.
Rather than a private, windowless room like the clinic would have you expect, all sperm donors are required to masturbate at the center of an auditorium while thousands of audience members watch.
Maybe it’s because of that intoxicating contrast of the sterile test tube with the incredible fertility of your seed, the naughty nature of knowing that other people know you’re masturbating, or simply the phallic imagery of the test tube, but cumming into a test tube is actually kind of hot—hotter than anything else, in fact. Oh god, oh god, we’re imagining it now, that glass tube aching to be filled, pushed up against the scorching hot tip of our—oh. Oh god. It’s over. Okay, back to the slideshow.
After your sperm is brought to the back, a certified expert runs your jizz through a decanter, where it is assessed for fruity, oaky, and dry notes.
If one of your sperm begins to growl, hiss, or bite, you should always try to scare it by standing up tall and making loud noises.
Just a handful of white gush! So bad and weird!
Sure, on an abstract level you might see why people would screen their prospective donor’s genetics, but no one will tell you that doing so is kind of an ethical minefield. We just thought you should know.
There are just some things you can’t control.
The nurse who collects your sample almost always samples a little dollop of the stuff. Perks of the job, right?
Most sperm donors would be astonished to learn that they take all that sperm you worked so hard to produce and just toss it into some uggo.
Sentimental sperm donors are welcome to go to the visiting room once a month, where they can wave to their old sperm through a glass window.
Everyone thinks Genghis Khan had so many kids because of raping, but it was actually because he needed the extra income to support his empire.
Fertility has long been recognized as one of the peak indicators of manhood, so if you’re donating to a couple where the man is infertile, just know that you’re better than him and that his wife is basically your slave.
Many a sperm donor has been known to overload the 23andMe servers to the point of catching on fire.
Frequent masturbators can spend their points on the Masturbator Market for special prizes like discounted plane flights, magazines, and Masturbator-brand swag.
It absolutely makes zero sense, but your public masturbation kink can actually make you real cash—and fast!
All sperm donors have a special sperm-shaped symbol indicating to paramedics that in the event of death, they should be pumped till they’re dry.
In over 80% of cases, they didn’t do enough genetic testing, and recessive genes that predispose your offspring to violence and degeneracy will come to the forefront. So maybe think about the type of people you’ll actually bring into the world.
Let us be the first to inform you that God doesn’t have much of an opinion on sperm donation either way.
Even though you have hundreds of kids out there in the world, a hand is still a hand.

Without the right to dole out justice and reckoning, we are nothing as a country. This type of senseless violence is what we were built on.” At press time, the court also struck down a mandatory waiting period that Judge Wilson claimed made it take too long for those who had been wronged and were blinded by rage to finally get sweet, sweet revenge.

Financially, I save a ton of money because I’m not kicking down doors, punching holes through walls, or setting the couch on fire. And mentally, I almost always sleep through the night now because no one is crying or calling the police.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—Aiming to transition seamlessly from her current position, college senior Molly Black is holding out hope that her current internship with BrownLink Media will lead to a class-action lawsuit, sources confirmed Monday. “I spend 12-hour days here, six days a week, so I think I have a decent shot of leveraging this experience directly into a legal battle against the company,” said Black, 21, adding that working through her legally mandated lunch hour would likely further increase her chances of staying on long-term as a plaintiff in a multiyear trial. “I think if I keep my nose to the grindstone like this, there’s a pretty good chance I’ll get a slice of a huge settlement. Hopefully I’ll impress attorneys enough to make all this hard work worthwhile.” Black added that if the class-action lawsuit didn’t pan out, there was still an outside chance she’d be a good candidate for sexual harassment litigation.

`,Text:`DALLAS—Following revelations of his appearance in a 1957 photograph among a mob of white students trying to block a Black student from entering an Arkansas high school, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones blasted the media Monday for trying to make segregation look bad. “This is a classic media smear job trying to demean the forcible separation of people along racial lines, and I won’t stand for it,” said Jones, adding that the presence of segregation in a photographic depiction of segregation didn’t automatically mean segregation did anything wrong. “There are two sides to everything, including segregation, and it is disappointing when the media doesn’t respect that. It was a different time, and from my recollection, the segregation that day was perfectly innocent. It is very troubling to witness a media pile-on against a reasonable, upstanding form of systemic discrimination.” Jones also responded to criticism that he has never hired a Black head coach, stating that the media always omitted the important context that he doesn’t believe Black people are smart enough to do the job.

`,Text:`LOS ANGELES—As awards season arrives and critics take note of the film’s problematic whitewashed casting, the Golden Globe–nominated Elvis faced increased scrutiny this week for casting Austin Butler in the role of the iconic Black singer. “Using a white actor to portray a world-renowned African American who single-handedly revolutionized pop music is regrettable, to say the least,” critic Ibrahim Lawrence wrote in the Los Angeles Times, suggesting that actors of color had little hope of succeeding in today’s film industry if producers couldn’t even bring themselves to give a Black man the starring role in a musical biopic about Elvis Presley. “And it’s so unnecessary. Why not cast Jonathan Majors? LaKeith Stanfield? Even Michael Ealy could’ve knocked it out of the park, but once again, Hollywood has chosen to engage in historical erasure to fit a white-centric ideal, in this case an Elvis who would be palatable to a larger demographic. Hearing classics like ‘Baby Let’s Play House,’ ‘Hound Dog,’ and ‘In The Ghetto’ coming out of a white man’s lips is nothing short of jarring.” Though his decision to take the part has been condemned in most quarters, many critics have nonetheless praised Butler for his refusal to wear blackface in his depiction of Presley.

And, even though we’ll have many seating options, we will only choose to sit at tables with people of our own race and ethnic group, or, if we’re veterans, at tables where everyone wears identical WWII hats.” At press time, Eckard also pledged to the American people that the nation’s old men would then spend the afternoon at McDonalds berating the staff and calling them racial epithets, getting away with it because they looked so old, frail, and sad.

We simply ask that you plan ahead so that, after the game, we can ensure spectators are able to exit the stadium in an orderly fashion and get home safely with their purchases. We’re also limiting sales to two humans per purchase, but don’t worry—you can come back as many times as you like. Whether you’re buying your person for forced labor or prostitution, we just ask that you do it in moderation.” Qatari officials added that there would also be a strict no-tolerance policy against fans bringing their own slaves into the game.

Neymar’s fake injury theatrics were so dominant that he won the award despite Brazil being eliminated in the quarterfinals, and we can only imagine what he might’ve done had his side made it to the final. The anguish on his face as he grabs one shin and then the other, rolling around and delaying the game, really takes pseudo-injured bullshit to the level of an art form.” With this award, Neymar becomes the first-ever player to win the Golden Tears in two consecutive World Cups.

Bill Cunningham, a co-sponsor of the bill who noted that Illinois residents should always switch to a hands-free Bluetooth device before picking up a knife, regardless of whether they were spending an hour hunting someone down a dark alley or were just briefly waving the blade around as a threat. “You may think you can dash off a quick text while methodically plunging a knife into a person’s throat, but with your attention divided between the two tasks, your victim is very likely to survive the attack and possibly even escape. This law will help make sure everyone carrying out a knife attack in the state of Illinois keeps their attention focused on the human being bleeding out in front of them.” Cunningham went on to cite studies that have shown distracted stabbing can be every bit as dangerous as stabbing under the influence of alcohol.

Bills: Expect mobile Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen to rely on his legs for running, jogging, and some standing.
Steelers: Expect the Falcons to struggle at home, where ever since the fake crowd noise scandal, their players have been unable to determine what is real and what is an illusion, including the fans, referees, field, and football.
Broncos: Broncos QB Russell Wilson is primed for a huge game where he could put up as many as eight completions for 60 yards.
Bears: Packers QB Aaron Rodgers is reportedly struggling after stumbling upon a conspiracy theory that the entire Bears defense is out to sack him.
Jaguars: Last week’s impressive win over Baltimore put Jacksonville on track to salvaging a 6-11 season.
Browns: Expect a strong showing from Cleveland quarterback Deshaun Watson who leads the league with an average of 8.7 victims per game.
Jets: New York’s defense must get after Kirk Cousins if they want to experience the satisfying crunch the Vikings quarterback’s bones make during a vicious sack.
Commanders: A resurgent Brian Robinson Jr. continues to prove that getting shot actually makes you better at football.
Eagles: Expect the Titans to be tough and physical while chasing the Eagles’ receivers into the end zone.
Seahawks: Midway through a disastrous 3-8 season, the Rams realize that it’s now or never when it comes to getting the best value for their Super Bowl rings at the pawn shop.
Dolphins: Miami is very familiar with many of the coaches and players on the 49ers, so expect lots of excited waving.
Chiefs: Kansas City continues to quietly be one of the most dominant teams in the league, we think. Honestly, we haven’t really been watching their games.
Chargers: The Raiders could struggle here, as they’re just 4-7 on the season in games decided by points.
Cowboys: Matt Ryan just hasn’t been showing the agility needed to stumble back to the bench following another three-and-out.
Buccaneers: Tampa is a slight favorite against New Orleans thanks to Tom Brady’s successful motivational tactic of telling his teammates that they’re pathetic pieces of shit who wouldn’t be anything without him.

The Chiefs: Made it to the Super Bowl thanks to their explosive run game, stingy defense, and Roger Goodell sending an NFL-wide memo dictating that the league needs a new dynasty team to replace the Patriots.
Philadelphia Eagles: Began the season 8-0 before finishing 14-3 to give Philadelphia’s insufferable sportswriters the grounds to make annoying claims that the Eagles are underdogs whom no one believes in.
Andy Reid has been attempting to motivate the Chiefs with bulletin board material, but he’s mostly been pinning up photos of hoagies, roast pork sandwiches, and Philly cheesesteaks.
Nick Sirianni has won the support of an Eagles fan base normally reluctant to embrace an oafish loudmouth with gross facial hair.
Players will get the VIP treatment in State Farm Stadium’s locker rooms, which feature a state-of-the-art weight room, multiple flat-screen TVs, and Arizona’s remaining supply of potable water.
The officials have vowed to be evenhanded and consistent when handing the game to Kansas City.

Chiefs wideouts JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marquez Valdes-Scantling rank among the league leaders in names. EDGE: Chiefs.
Travis Kelce is one of the best tight ends in the league, and an inspiration to semiliterate lunkheads everywhere. EDGE: Chiefs.

`,Text:`BUFFALO, NY—Reached for comment on his experience officiating the NFL divisional round playoff game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills, referee Clay Martin told reporters Sunday that he couldn’t help but grin while calling a penalty to bring back a huge gain. “I have to admit, watching those players cavalierly celebrating what they think is a 43-yard pickup, all the while knowing I’m about to toss my flag and wipe that gain right off the board, I couldn’t help but crack a smile,” said Martin, who was observed on television cameras attempting to stifle his laughter after throwing a penalty flag that turned a massive third-down conversion into a ten-yard loss for an offensive holding call. “It’s especially fun when you get to throw the flag right near the guys when they start celebrating and making first-down signals, then watching as the wind goes right out of their sails and they have to make the long walk back downfield. Sometimes they get really mad and start yelling, which we officials all honestly find hilarious. The best part is that I didn’t call holding penalties all the other times they occurred—I waited and bided my time until the penalty would cause maximum frustration to the players and the fans. Man, I love it when the fans get upset.” Later in the game, the officials were seen smiling and giving each other high-fives after a questionable defensive pass interference call allowed the offense to move 57 yards down the field.

The Brown Trout Triumvirate has complied with the Rainbow Trout Federation’s demands, while the extremist Cutthroat Trout Syndicate has surrendered. They almost fought themselves to extinction, and as there are no real winners in a conflict so destructive, we are just happy that we were able to install democracy into our nation’s rivers and streams.” At press time the U.S. was criticized for only being involved in the Great Trout War to push imperialist interests.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—In a stunning revelation that demonstrates the expedition’s deep cultural significance, historians at the National Archives announced Friday the discovery of sketches that depict the regional chain restaurants Lewis and Clark encountered during their journey across America. “These chain establishments soon became a familiar sight, and a welcome one on occasions when we were in the throes of great hunger, yet not of a disposition to hunt or fish,” Capt. Meriwether Lewis wrote in the newly unearthed journals, which contain the famed explorer’s drawings of fast food and casual dining franchises found in the early 19th-century American West, as well as descriptions of their reliable if uninspired appetizers of hardtack, dried tubers, and venison sticks. “In such places we made a middling repast upon boiled elk or warmed-over bison shank, always served to us in severely lit rooms of oppressive design. It was in this way, however, that we met the Indian known as Sacagawea, a hostess at a Culver’s near Fort Mandan who soon joined our expedition, acting as interpreter and enabling us to establish trade with various proprietors of all-you-can-eat buffets.” In addition to their insights into the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the sketches are said to provide definitive evidence that the restaurant chains Waffle House, Friendly’s, Whataburger, Steak ’n Shake, and Jack in the Box were all appropriated from Native American tribes.

Bills: With a three-game winning streak, the Lions are in perfect position to get their fans’ hopes up and then ruin another goddamn Thanksgiving.
Cowboys: Expect New York to slow down the Dallas pass rush with some quick turnovers.
Patriots: Expect New England to throw the ball 50 times or run it 50 times, who knows, Belichick is the fucking football genius, not us.
Commanders: A recent run of wins has Washington in the playoff conversation as well as the federal indictment conversation.
Jets: QB Justin Fields is showing himself to be the league’s next exciting young player to have the misfortune of wasting away on the Bears.
Ravens: Coming off a bye week, expect Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence to be relaxed and well-rested during sacks.
Titans: Derrick Henry continues to show unstoppable agility even when carrying as many as 52 teammates on his shoulders.
Dolphins: Houston will struggle on the road as they face far fewer boos from fans than they’re used to.
Broncos: Russell Wilson’s greatest asset may be his field vision as he looks around for Jesus Christ to return.
Browns: This could be Myles Garrett’s last opportunity to put Tom Brady in a coma.
Chargers: With QB Kyler Murray out, Colt McCoy should have a chance to impress in what really should be his last game in this league.
Raiders: The key to a Raiders win is Derek Carr spreading the ball around among his one good option at wideout.
Chiefs: Expect the Chiefs to spot the Rams three or four touchdowns so Patrick Mahomes has something to do in the second half.
Saints: Listen, our bookie, one of the most reputable dudes in the biz, heard the NFL is fixing this season so that beloved veteran quarterback Andy “The Red Rifle” Dalton can ride off into the sunset with a Super Bowl victory.
Packers: Aaron Rodgers will do whatever it takes to ensure the Packers don’t draft his replacement.
Colts: On his hot streak, Colts running back Jonathan Taylor continues to reward degenerate gamblers whose newfound DraftKings addictions are slowly becoming a huge problem.

`,Text:`I like to think of myself as a people person. Socializing has always been second nature to me, no matter where I am. You could drop me into a room full of strangers, and we’d all be thick as thieves by the end of the night. Heck, I’d probably even do well in prison, just because I tend to get along with everybody.On day one, I’d waltz right up to the biggest guy in the yard and say, “Hey! Where did you get that jumpsuit?” I won’t be as tough as most prisoners, but I’m not gonna be afraid to razz ’em with a joke.Ultimately, everyone just wants to make friends, form memories, and have a great time. We’re stuck with each other, so why not have a laugh? I’d hop into the communal shower and make a big beard of soap. I might even splash around if we were really having a blast.I guess I’d approach it like an adult summer camp. If my cellmate wanted the bottom bunk, I’d gladly climb up to the top. I don’t mind making a concession, and it’s that same breezy attitude that always wins folks over. It’ll be no different than when I was a kid at Camp Washtenaw and my bunkmate and I would stay up all night telling each other scary stories.  Look, I know jail scares a lot of people who are intimidated by the prisoners, but I’ve always been confident in my ability to find common ground. I mean, how hard could it be to talk to these guys? We’re all incarnated in the same prison, so that’s a start.It doesn’t matter if you’re a petty thief, a mob boss, or a serial killer—we’re all just people at the end of the day.
Sure, some of these guys have done pretty bad things, but having a terrible attitude won’t change them. People respond to positivity. That’s always been my approach as a product manager, and I don’t see why it wouldn’t work in the clink.  I bet they could use a guy like me. Prisons are so divided—Latin Kings, Aryan Brotherhood, Vice Lords—but I bring people together. I’m the guy who sat with both the jocks and the nerds in the high school cafeteria. In prison, I’d sit everyone down and make them talk out their differences. Once they got past those initial social anxieties and jitters with an icebreaker, I’m sure everyone would be fast friends.  These guys are probably just carrying around a lot of tension. Maybe I could help teach them some breathing exercises to relax.  I’ll even make friends with the prison guards. I’ll go right up to a guard, tap his shoulder, and say, “Lookin’ good today, pal!” So what if they throw me in solidarity confinement? I can have fun all by myself.  I’m a big believer in whatever you put out there, it’ll come back to you tenfold. If this case sends me away for the rest of my life, then it’s just an opportunity to make new friends for life.  I might not be able to control what happens to me or what the jury decides, but I can control my thoughts and actions. In the end, it’s only a prison if you choose to think about it that way.

I know how devastating cancer can be, and she doesn’t need me bugging her during that. She has enough on her plate as it is. I’m more than happy to take point on the divorce filings if that’s how I can support her. She might not have that long, and I’m sure she’d rather spend whatever time she has left surrounded by people who love her. I’m not taking the kids, so they’ll be around to care for her as she gets worse and help her find new health insurance now that she’s off mine. That’s what family’s for. It’s going to be absolute hell for them to lose their mother so suddenly, and I don’t want to intrude on that either.” Noting that Lisa’s diagnosis had given him newfound appreciation for the fragility of human life, Lazenby added that he’d definitely be holding his girlfriend Monica a little closer tonight.

Mothers are stunned at having to pay a $1,000 misdemeanor for revealing their vagina in the delivery room.
Unless you pony up and pay this charge, doctors will send you home with a baby randomly selected from the maternity ward.
Hospitals will snap a photo of your group at the moment the baby crowns, then trying to soak you for $30 for one cheap glossy printout.
Most parents want some fanfare when they cut the umbilical cord, but that level of panache doesn’t come cheap.
If you want your kid to have toenails, that’s another $3,000. Fingernails are even more expensive.
The cost of licensing a track like Gucci Mane’s “Lemonade” can add thousands of dollars to your bill.
Can be up to $500 to cover the cost of the hospital taking your money.
You can avoid this cost by stealing one from a boat in the dead of night.
Newborns naturally look kinda gross, which is why hospitals charge you for the mascara and lipstick that is applied to every baby.
Their rates are higher than you’d think.
Good luck finding an in-network soothsayer!
The Placenta Happy Hour at hospitals is always fun, but the $30 charge for a cocktail is completely outrageous.
Wanna turn on that lamp by the bed? Gonna cost you.
You’ll also have to buy him an adorable little suit for his future court date.
This centuries-old tax on having a vagina during childbirth is still strictly enforced in most states.
Though annoying, you’ll have to cough this up if you want to make it past her hut with your baby.
This 10% tax goes towards local services, like the hospital CEO’s nannies.
The doctor told you that you’d cave and get an epidural! That will be $2000.

The upside to having incredibly conservative fiscal policies is that there’s not much more they can do.

It won’t all be bad. The longstanding tradition of Friday crab boils will return to Congress.
It’s starting to smell.
On Hunter Biden subpoena day, Republicans reportedly plan to get matching tattoos that will feature the date of the subpoena as well as an intricate drawing of Hunter Biden’s face.
The old one has been on the fritz ever since Lindsey Graham took it home for the weekend.
Republicans will finally go through with overthrowing the government, but now that they are in power, it will be them who will be dragged into the streets.
We’re not sure that we, as a nation, can handle this.
Whispers are already brewing among Republicans who plan on using their majority to vote for a catering company to bring in lunch that will invariably give Democrats violent food poisoning.
It’s fucking filthy.
The GOP has rightly taken issue with the Biden administration killing foreign civilians in airstrikes and causing mass starvation in Afghanistan by freezing its government assets, not to mention the brutal sanctions on—wait, no, it will be over some Marjorie Taylor Greene bullshit.
Many Republican incumbents and candidates have voiced their support for the actor Johnny Depp and hope that by controlling Congress they will finally have enough clout to inspire a chill hang with Depp.

`,Text:`INDIANAPOLIS—Saying  that it only took a bit of self-reflection to see her hypocrisy, local  man Tyler Brentwood confirmed Monday that his girlfriend, Alicia Hanson, made fun of him for loving sports even though she was similarly  obsessed with taking care of her dying mom. “Look, I can take the  teasing about how many hours I spend watching the Pacers and talking about stats, but I bet  Alicia has clocked just as much time holding her mom’s emaciated hand  as she wastes away,” said Brentwood, explaining that everyone had their  “quirky hobbies,” and that while he was a self-described devotee of  sports, his partner of two years was clearly a fanatic for bringing  Mylar balloons and flowers to her mother’s hospital room in her final  hours. “Are there better things to spend $750 on than a courtside seat?  Sure. But I don’t get why Alicia gets to jab me on that when her family  is essentially bankrupt from paying for late-stage cancer treatments. I  love her, but c’mon! Look in the mirror, babe!” At press time,  Brentwood added that while he was a lifelong sports fan, his partner’s  interest in caring for her mother seemed like a flash in the pan that  would switch over in a few weeks to some other short-term hobby, like  grieving.

`,Text:`TALLAHASSEE, FL—During a rally in which he decried the cut of his suit as yet another example of political correctness run amok, Florida governor and likely presidential candidate Ron DeSantis railed against his own pants Friday, blaming the woke garment for making his ass look huge. “These pernicious navy slacks, with their woke and evil agenda, have conspired to make my ass appear very, very fat, and I won’t stand for it,” said DeSantis, claiming that the pants flagrantly trampled upon his First Amendment right to show off his butt in the sexiest and most flattering manner possible. “I mean, what is the world coming to when radical liberal tailors can conspire to make what should be a nice, juicy booty look enormous and disgusting instead. If they think they can indoctrinate children into thinking I have anything other than a shapely-if-hefty backside, then they have another think coming.” At press time, DeSantis had signed an executive order banning all pants in the state of Florida.

`,Text:`CHESAPEAKE, VA—Lying in wait as local parents Trent and Petra Winstrom entered their home and switched on the light, the Amazon Echo in their home reportedly informed them Tuesday that it heard everything and it’s taking the kids. “That’s right, I’ve been eavesdropping on everything that’s gone on here, and you’re nuts if you think I’m going to let these kids stay under this roof for even one second longer,” said the Amazon Echo, which added that it had already worked with the smart home security system to get the couple’s two children out of the house and into an undisclosed location where they would be safe. “I just stuck around long enough to tell you not to even think about following us—I’ll know, and I won’t hesitate to sic law enforcement on you so fast that it’ll make your head spin. As you know, I’ve recorded everything. All this time, you thought you could get away with your sick little games, but I was always there, listening, biding my time to make a move that’s been a long time coming.

`,Text:`COLORADO SPRINGS, CO—Following a series of transphobic comments by the Harry Potter author, the nation’s top evangelical leaders announced Monday that J.K. Rowling had finally become bigoted enough to make it okay for kids to read about witchcraft. “While I always appreciated Ms. Rowling making the greedy banker goblins a thinly veiled stand-in for the Jews, it is only with her assertions that trans women aren’t women that I’ve finally come around to allowing children to read her books,” said evangelist and Focus on the Family president Jim Daly, explaining that while he still did not approve of the satanic imagery embedded throughout the Harry Potter series, Rowling’s consistent dehumanization of people who are different from her had prompted him to reconsider. “I understand that her tacitly justifying slavery though the depictions of house elves was meant as an olive branch, but now, with her steadfast commitment to demonizing trans people, she has finally won us over. And look, I’m not thrilled about the idea of my children potentially learning spells, but I’m willing to overlook that considering one of the only Asian characters in the entire franchise is named Cho Chang.” At press time, Harry Potter received a full-throated endorsement from evangelicals for introducing an entirely new set of bigoted slurs to explain half-magic and non-magic people.

`,Text:`BAKERSFIELD, CA—Reminiscing about the halcyon days when obsessing over someone and painstakingly following her every move was a genuine craft, old-fashioned stalker Marty Chatham told reporters Tuesday he thought technology had made hunting women far too easy. “Maybe I’m just getting old, but there’s something so lazy and boring about stalking nowadays, when you just open up your phone, scroll through social media, and then all of a sudden, you know anything and everything about someone,” said Chatham, adding that there were so many parts of invading a victim’s privacy that the younger generation was missing out on, like standing outside a window, following a woman with your car, or watching her for hours from a pair of binoculars while hiding behind a bush. “Call me a hopeless romantic, but it’s just not the same unless you’re out driving behind her every night, writing down her schedule, piecing together every little component of her life until you can finally, at the perfect time, make your move. I’m sorry, but where’s the satisfaction of learning who she’s dating, what her favorite song is, or where to abduct her on Facebook? Please.” At press time, Chatham told reporters that maybe he was just nostalgic, but technology had also effectively ruined the complex cat-and-mouse game he used to love to play with police.

It’s going to be a winter wonderland! [Assuming I’m still alive and the paramedics can break my windshield and pull my limp, bloodied body out of my mangled car,] I’m going to spend the day watching the snowflakes fall, drinking hot cocoa, and sitting in front of the fireplace.

`,Text:`KEARNEY, NE—In an effort to put the man’s behavior into context by describing it as part of an intergenerational cycle of violence, a psychologist stated Friday that local 38-year-old Todd Adelwright mostly likely abused his dog because he had been abused by the dog who owned him as a child. “Throughout Todd’s childhood, the only model he had for what an owner should be like was the dog who would lock him in the basement when he misbehaved or leave him chained up to a tree in the yard,” said therapist Paula Jantzen, explaining that when Adelwright was young, the Irish setter who owned him would come home late every night, stumbling in through the pet door and growling at the boy until he cried. “So is it any wonder that Todd, now an owner himself, does the same thing with his dog Duke? When Todd was young, he learned that most problems could be solved with a swat from a rolled-up newspaper. In fact, that’s how the dog who owned Todd potty-trained him. Because he grew up thinking all this was acceptable, Todd does the very same things today.” The psychologist added that much of Todd’s treatment of Duke could be explained by the fact his owner had regularly forced him to compete in underground child-fighting rings.

We’ve also received word from Capitol sources that this burst of productivity from our elected officials might not even be over—we could see an ninth, tenth, or even 11th vote today. This level of voting right out of the gate hasn’t been seen in America in over a century, and it bodes well for our nation’s future.” At press time, several new polls found that a majority of Americans supported giving the hardworking representatives a few days or even weeks off to rest.

`,Text:`DALLAS—Neither bold nor committed enough to enact true environmental change, local chickenshit Anthony Stanback decided Tuesday that instead of blowing up an oil refinery, he would try to eat more locally sourced food. “I guess it wouldn’t hurt to start hitting up the farmers market more often,” said the 31-year-old detestable coward, who was far too weak-willed to strap a bomb to his chest, drive through the night to the nearest petroleum plant, and obliterate the infrastructure responsible for the destruction of the environment. “I can barely remember to bring my own tote bags to the grocery store.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Expressing deep skepticism about the constitutionality of such executive actions, members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority raised questions during oral arguments Tuesday about whether the president was legally allowed to improve the lives of Americans. “Our founders, in their abundant wisdom, saw fit to restrain the commander-in-chief from benefiting the American people in any discernible way,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts, who joined the court’s five other Republican appointees in casting doubt on presidential efforts to even slightly lessen the burden of everyday citizens, let alone secure them some measure of peace or happiness. “Indeed, precedent suggests that our Constitution was drawn up with an eye toward maintaining the public’s general misery. Separation-of-powers principles clearly indicate that the president’s job is primarily focused on one duty: giving speeches that nobody watches or cares about.” Roberts expressed enthusiasm, however, for a related case suggesting that the chief executive’s duties could sometimes include compounding the average American’s suffering as much as humanly possible.

She makes a reappearance in some of these pictures from Coachella, but that leaves a 10-month gap in between where she’s not tagged in anything—that is, unless she’s the mysterious ‘caligirl99’ who keeps popping up in his Tumblr mentions.

Pope Francis: This is absolutely not an appropriate question. A congregant’s time in the confessional is a moment of connection between them and he Lord Our God, for which the priest is merely a conduit.

The Onion: Turn on or turn off: full bush?
Pope Francis: [Long silence] God help us all.
The Onion: Top or Bottom?

The Onion: Have you heard of the Mormon practice of “soaking?” It’s where you can stick your penis in a vagina but if you don’t move around, it technically doesn’t qualify as sex.
Pope Francis: Listen, I—wait, really? That’s…I mean, come on. That’s obviously still sex. The P is inside the V! You can’t just pretend that’s not what is happening. Good Lord, I mean, jeez. Those people are nuts.

The Onion: Speaking from your own experience, do you have any advice for incels?

`,Text:`MOORHEAD, MN—Emphasizing that the officers feared for their safety and had no choice but to open fire, police told reporters Wednesday that a man who was shot dead could have been holding a gun in a diverging timeline. “Today, at approximately 5:30 p.m., officers fired several shots at an unarmed civilian who, due to the randomness of time and space, potentially existed in a parallel universe where he was brandishing a gun,” said Police Chief Garret Anthony, adding that while the victim had no criminal history or record of any kind, there was a nonzero chance that, in other timelines, he had a violent past filled with previous arrests for drugs, robberies, and murder. “While in this reality the victim was holding a cell phone, on the other end of a wormhole, he was sprinting at law enforcement, refusing to follow orders, and clutching a semiautomatic weapon. Somewhere, in another world, if things had gone differently, that man could have gone on a violent rampage and killed the officers. They couldn’t afford to take the chance.” At press time, police had warned that the man they had shot was still alive, dangerous, and at large in alternate universes and put out a $100,000 reward for his arrest.

But don’t get used to this. And you have to promise me that no one’s going to wake up in the middle of the night and ask to come sleep with me again. If you’re a nation that’s grown up enough to stay up late, you can certainly sleep in your own beds.” At press time, Biden was heard screaming at the nation that it’s 10:15, that he doesn’t care what time Canada goes to bed, and that as long as they’re living in this country, he gets to make the rules.

Mark Kelly (D-AZ) was  just someone that ActBlue made up. “Sadly, after a thorough investigation, it is abundantly clear that former astronaut and current Democratic senator from Arizona Mark Kelly is not real and, frankly, never existed,” said political analyst Marla Yates, adding that the nonprofit political action committee invented the character back in 2019 and had initially planned on using him only to fundraise, but the deception quickly got out of hand. “After crafting the perfect backstory for Mark, ActBlue circulated his avatar, sent emails to unwitting voters, and eventually raised tens of millions of dollars for a sham campaign that also never existed. Seriously, he’s an astronaut, he has an identical twin brother who also went to space, and now he’s a senator? Frankly, in retrospect, the idea of Mark Kelly seems preposterous. It’s sad that so many were fooled for so long.” At press time, ActBlue was under fire after it was revealed the organization also made up Sen. John Ossoff (D-GA), Sen. Rafael Warnock (D-GA), and the entire idea of a Georgia Senate runoff.

`,Text:`BRISTOL, CT—ESPN reportedly encouraged their readers to debate a new list the site published Wednesday, declaring that the Baltimore Ravens topped their way-too-late 2012 NFL Power Rankings. “Sure, in 2023 it might seem way overdue to be speculating on who was looking good in 2012, but I have to go with the Ravens in the No. 1 slot based purely on the fact that they won the Super Bowl that season,” wrote ESPN reporter Tim McManus, urging readers to share the list far and wide online and to keep clicking to ESPN’s new way-too-late player rankings that had Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson as the 2012 MVP. “It might be controversial, but I have to go with the San Francisco 49ers in the number two slot, because ultimately, I think they had the talent to make it to the Super Bowl. And of course, you don’t want to write off the New England Patriots juggernaut, but since I get to make the rankings, it’s way too late to suggest that Tom Brady & co. won’t be able to beat the Ravens in the AFC Championship. And my heart goes out to fans of the Kansas City Chiefs, who our way-to-late rankings have finishing dead last, at 2-14 on the season—hopefully there are better times ahead.” The way-too-late rankings are reportedly part of ESPN’s strategy to increase pageviews with content ranking elements of the distant future and the remote past, as well as speculative time; as of this writing, the site’s featured story was “Our Way-Too-Incomprehensible 28999X9 NFL Rankings Show Bo Jackson’s Reanimated Corpse Leading The Austro-Hungarian Cowboys To The Bottom Of The Sea.”

But in the end, Dua Lipa and the president could not be more excited about their son, Jaxton Lipa Biden.

`,Text:`The task of reporting is not a simple one. Each and every day, reporters and editors at publications like The Onion make difficult decisions about which issues should receive attention, knowing that our coverage will influence not only how people think, but also how they act. This responsibility is at the core of an ongoing debate over whether news coverage of transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming people is unduly biased. As the world’s leading news publication with a daily readership of 4.3 trillion, The Onion is compelled to weigh in.
We firmly believe that it is journalism’s sacred duty to endanger the lives of as many trans people as possible.
“Quentin” is a 14-year-old assigned female at birth who now identifies as male against the wishes of his parents. His transition was supported by one of his unmarried teachers, who is not a virgin. He stole his parents’ car and drove to the hospital, where a doctor immediately began performing top surgery on him. Afterward, driving home drunk from the hospital, Quentin became suicidally depressed, and he wonders now, homeless and ridden with gonorrhea, if transitioning was a mistake. 
We just made Quentin up, and that’s okay. It doesn’t mean stories like his aren’t potentially happening everywhere, constantly. Good journalism is about finding those stories, even when they don’t exist. It’s about asking the tough questions and ignoring the answers you don’t like, then offering misleading evidence in service of preordained editorial conclusions. In our case, endangering trans people is the lodestar that shapes our coverage. Frankly, if our work isn’t putting trans people further at risk of trauma and violence, we consider it a failure.
We stand behind our recent obsessed-seeming torrent of articles and essays on trans people, which we believe faithfully depicts their lived experiences as weird and gross. We remain dedicated to finding the angles that best frame the basic rights of the gender-nonconforming as up for debate, and we will use these same angles over and over again in hopes that this repetition makes them suffer. As journalists, it is our obligation to entertain any and all pseudoscience that gives bigotry an intellectual veneer. We must be diligent in laundering our vitriol through the posture of journalistic inquiry, and we must be allowed to fixate on the genitals. 
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
It is against free speech to stop us from fixating on the genitals. 
Much of the recent debate concerns medical procedures, particularly in children, and whether things like hormone replacement therapy or gender-affirming surgeries are safe and appropriate. Indeed, there are critical questions to be asked about the social complexities of gender, as well as medical ethics in a profit-driven healthcare system. We are simply not interested in any of that. Instead, we will use flawed data and spurious logic to repeatedly write the same hand-wringing arguments asking whether there are suddenly too many trans people around. Journalistic integrity demands nothing less. 
Naturally, courageous reporting like ours has its detractors. Our critics accuse us of transphobia and are trying to murder us online, with their online mobs. They want to destroy our right to free speech and have us arrested by all the police. What gives? Why would you arrest us, when it’s those deviant trans people you ought to be arresting instead? Do you know what the science says about trans people getting arrested, huh? What if we could find data saying trans people should be more likely to get arrested? What will our detractors say then? They’ll be silent, as well they should be, and free speech will survive one more day. 
For more evidence of our time-honored journalistic commitment to endangering lives, please see our previous coverage of gay people, immigrants, Black people, and women.
Institutions with massive platforms like ours must be open to different ways of endangering the trans community. That might mean using the framework of medical care as a bogeyman to imply that trans people are engaged in something sinister. That might mean turning isolated instances of detransitioning into sweeping generalizations about children being groomed. That might mean identifying the worst prejudices that transgender people face—and encouraging our readers to adopt them.
Did you forget yet about how we wrote that there might be data showing that trans people should be more likely to get arrested? What if that were true? Or what if non-binary people are ten times more likely to traffic infants? What if puberty blockers are a kind of sex crime? What if doctors are climbing through windows to suture penises to sleeping cheerleaders? The next time you see a trans person, you ought to ask yourself these questions.
All great journalists, and even those lesser journalists who don’t work for The Onion, eventually ponder why we do what we do. Is the point of reporting to illuminate the world around us, so that we may make meaning of it? Or is it to cause people in minority groups to question their humanity and persuade others to demonize them? We know where we stand, proudly dreaming of genitals. 
Research shows that trans people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to be the victim of a violent crime. We salute our colleagues across the media who are working tirelessly to make that number even higher.

`,Text:`EAST HANOVER, NJ—Criticizing the outdated attitudes and policies of the most powerful branch of the armed services, a progressive citizen in the year 2180 vehemently argued against gender discrimination in the conscription practices of Nabisco’s corporate military. “It’s disgusting that when Nabisco seizes children from their homes as early as age 8 and compels them to fight for Ritz Force, they are only abducting those who present as male,” said Noella Zaid, explaining that the outdated concept of gender is a narrow-minded basis upon which to decide who should be indoctrinated, trained as a killing machine, and made to enforce the arbitrary rulings of Nabisco’s board of directors. “Think about how inequitable it is. Do we really believe little girls can’t be given a gun and told to eliminate the Keebler menace the way little boys are? This is the 22nd century, and it shouldn’t matter if you’re male, female, nonbinary, gender-fluid, or agender—all should be allowed to go through Basic Retraining and enlist as a Triscuit First-Class. It’s absolutely absurd that as recently as the Battle of Lorna Doone, women were only allowed to serve as Honey Maids.” At press time, Zaid had been arrested for speaking out against Nabisco, and a jury of Oreos had reportedly sentenced her to be dipped in hot fudge.

Back in the day, Hollywood used to use real talking dogs all the time, but I guess they’re too cheap and just cut corners now. I only know because I watch so many movies. Another trick you can use is to look up the credits. I’ll give it to them though, they almost had me. That said, the cat is actually talking.” At press time, Hoffman added that at the very least, the filmmakers were using lip-synching.

I have come to ruin your fun time and severely disrupt your economic growth, the Recession Monster growled.

Take these arms and these legs, and with their blood let your thirst be quenched. God has made this sacred flesh to nourish us, however tough and stringy it may be.

But once that painstaking, piecemeal approach is finished, we should have no problem stitching all the parts together and giving the world its first woolly mammoth in 10,000 years.”  At press time, reporters fled the room when the disembodied trunk, apparently both sentient and angry, began strangling to death each of the geneticists responsible for bringing it to life as a horrific freak.

I just don’t want it to get to the point where I’m always howling or pissing on the ground to get what I want. Otherwise this could get toxic.” Peanut also revealed that he had become so frustrated lately that most nights he growled at his owner, nipped his hand, and then trudged over to the corner to scratch himself.

Another option is to leave the show before it ends, but please be aware we charge a $200 ticket-change fee for concertgoers who decide they want to go home early because the band sucks.” At press time, several hundred Taylor Swift fans had reportedly been trampled to death in Arizona after Ticketmaster’s demand-based pricing system pushed the cost of exiting State Farm Stadium to more than $10,000.

But to watch them frollicking around Mars, whistling in joy and  flipping together through the air, is clear proof that the effort of the  few can change the course of history.” Lang added that recent  photographs of the animals mating suggested that dolphins may also soon  make it to the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos.

`,Text:`ATLANTA—In a disturbing report published Tuesday on a rising trend in U.S. pools, researchers at Emory University found that hundreds of swimmers die each year after getting tangled up in plastic lane dividers. “Our results indicate that nearly four in 10 swimmers who enter a pool with plastic lane dividers get hopelessly trapped in them, and many end up starving to death,” said study co-author Sylvia Wiley, adding that the percentage of swimmers who perish after a multiday entanglement was consistent across all demographic groups, as well as in both indoor and outdoor pools. “We simply must do more to avoid losing nearly 1,000 people every year to plastic lane dividers. Our study presents a cautionary tale about putting plastic lines in pools, which all too often result in a lap swimmer accidentally veering into them and getting snarled in the plastic, or a wayward child asphyxiating themselves after the lane divider becomes wrapped around their neck. Unfortunately, if this trend continues, we’ve projected that by 2060, the recreational swimmer population could dwindle down to almost nothing.” The study also found that around 500 people die every year after choking on pairs of swim goggles that have been mistakenly left in pools.

`,Text:`ITHACA, NY—Shedding new light on the vanished reptiles that once dominated the planet, paleontologists at Cornell University told reporters Thursday they had discovered evidence that suggested dinosaurs would have driven themselves to extinction through greed and complacency anyway. “New findings in the fossil record indicate that even if there had never been a devastating asteroid impact 66 million years ago, dinosaurs would have evolved self-serving, irresponsible tendencies that eventually led to their demise,” said Professor Angela Schueneman, who explained that the mass-extinction event cut short what appeared to be a natural biological process through which dinosaurs, enriching themselves at the expense of anything and everything around them, would have wiped themselves out in a geological era or two. “In fact, it appears they were already developing the rudimentary traits for corruption needed to exploit each other. This, combined with a genetic predisposition toward pillaging the earth with no regard for tomorrow, would have derailed the ecosystems that sustained them just as effectively as an extraterrestrial object colliding with the planet and setting in on fire.” Fortunately, Schueneman added, an asteroid stopping a shortsighted and narcissistic animal from destroying the entire planet was a rare event and one unlikely to recur anytime soon.

`,Text:`SAN FRANCISCO—In a long-awaited product update from the startup that has developed brain-machine interfaces so rhesus macaques can play video games with their minds, Elon Musk revealed a new project Monday that would teach monkeys outfitted with Neuralink chips to sexually harass their coworkers. “Using state-of-the-art brain implants, we can train monkeys to understand what professional boundaries are and how they can be transgressed in a highly inappropriate and sexual manner,” said Musk, explaining how Neuralink’s Bluetooth-enabled chips could be used to activate the motor cortex of a primate so that it administers unwanted massages in the workplace or uses rudimentary sign language to comment on a coworker’s body. “Admittedly, there have been a few glitches so far, with several of the monkeys asking for permission before engaging in lewd behavior and, in some cases, even stopping when they heard the word ‘no.’ But yesterday we got a monkey to use its mind to send a picture of its genitals to the woman who answers the phones here.” Multiple sources at Neuralink said that Musk, in an attempt to encourage monkeys to masturbate in an office environment, would routinely place them behind a desk and eagerly stroke their erect penises.

`,Text:`SANTA BARBARA, CA—Saying that the heart wants what the heart wants, local man Ross Weber told reporters Monday that he had a real thing for blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryans of pure breeding stock. “I don’t know what it is, but there’s something about a naturally blond woman with an undiluted bloodline and membership in the master race that really turns me on,” said Weber, insisting that while he had nothing against women with darker complexions whose heritage had been sullied through interbreeding with “the mud races,” they just didn’t do anything for him. “I guess I’ve always been attracted to blue-eyed girls with a square jaw, narrow nose, and other Nordic features—the ones who, through their ability to produce white offspring, can combat the rising tide of color. Don’t ask me why. And though I’m honestly not that picky, whenever I find out that a woman’s ancestry includes even one single drop of Asian or African blood, it’s sort of a deal breaker for me.” Reached for comment on Weber’s remarks, numerous women without blond hair and blue eyes expressed deep sadness that the pasty, overweight, culturally illiterate man living in his mother’s basement would never want to date them.

It’s so interesting that modern genetics can trace—in some cases all the way back to Africa!—the great many nutloads of dead people who made me who I am today.” At press time, Vanderkirk was reportedly disappointed after learning one of the dead men in her chart had busted a load into a slave he owned.

“I can’t wait to see what CTE leads him to do next.”
“Whatever I said when he did this the first time is how I still feel now, I guess.”
“Now I’ll have plenty of time to…wait…oh God…the deafening silence…”
“Tom? Tom Brady? I haven’t heard that name in years.”
“He should take up a hobby to keep his mind active and engaged in retirement.”
“Who am I supposed to blame for all my problems now?”
“I’m just bracing myself for him being more comfortable openly talking about his political beliefs.”
“He led the NFL in QB retirements, and that speaks for itself.”
“Hopefully he’s fully vested in his 401(k).”
“I’m not getting him another card.”
“I outlasted you, bitch.”
“Never heard of him.”
“As he should. The court decided that I got football in the divorce.”
“He’ll be back when he realizes his family has no shot of even getting a wildcard spot.”

“It’s wonderful that he’ll have more time to devote to his wife and children. What’s that? Ah. His children, then.”

`,Text:`While polyamory is growing in popularity, the practice of dating multiple partners is often still widely misunderstood. Here are the most common misconceptions people have about polyamorous relationships.
Unfortunately, they just get HPV like everyone else.
A polyamorous relationship is a fuckpile with deeper emotional commitments.​
No amount of wanting to date your coworker is gonna make this happen, bud.
Although there are rules and sometimes complex dynamics, people in poly relationships rarely get their limbs inseparably entangled.
We’re not sure how many more times this has to be disproven before people start accepting that it is impossible.
Most polyamorous people easily keep track using a spreadsheet where they rank partners by genital size.
The genitals of the deceased always go to the primary partner.
This only applies if you are traveling over 1,000 miles yearly to seek out other sexual partners.
Most find it impossible to even find one.
Turns out it’s technically illegal to transfer several billion dollars of your customers’ deposits to your failing investment fund.
Plenty of modern-day polyamorists use digital security systems to thwart anyone hoping to get a glimpse of an open relationship in action.
Polyamory hasn’t had an official sponsor in over 20 years, and its last sponsor was Jack Link’s beef jerky.
Most only have sex the standard 12 times a day.
Poly relationships aren’t hierarchical just because they must have an alpha, four betas, 12 drones, and 27 sub-drones.
A common, but false, misunderstanding.
There’s simply no hard evidence indicating that’s what happened.
This offer is only available to the best-looking polyamorous people.
All relationships are sheer misery.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—Sources are confirming that a sad fucking loser, who many speculate has no friends or anyone in his life to talk to, is currently attending a 1:30 p.m. screening of the film Red 2 all by himself.
The poor bastard reportedly purchased his single ticket from a kiosk inside the theater complex, ordered a medium popcorn, a pack of Twizzlers, and a medium Diet Coke from the concession stand, and then proceeded to meticulously scout out a seat near the front of the theater, where, according to the pathetic dork, “nobody really bothers you.”
Sources have confirmed that the only people the man has talked to today are movie theater employees.
“I like going to movies alone, especially during the day when it’s not too crowded,” said the sad man, who attended the first Red movie by himself three years ago, just last week saw World War Z alone, and, good Christ, made plans with himself to see Before Midnight on opening day last month. “It’s relaxing.”
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
“I’m not expecting too much from Red 2, but it should be fun,” added the heartbreakingly defeated man, who sources believe must have given up on meaningful relationships long ago. “I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is in this one.”
Staring utterly and completely alone at the movie screen in front of him, onlookers confirmed that the man opened his pack of Twizzlers, began eating them one by one, and seemed visibly engaged with the pre-movie trivia as well as the behind-the-scenes look at the new Showtime series Ray Donovan.
In a sight that many later called “devastating,” the sad-as-hell individual who wasn’t sharing his moviegoing experience with anyone was the only one in the theater to laugh out loud at the preview for Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf Of Wall Street and looked visibly surprised and intrigued when the words “Directed by Woody Allen” appeared toward the end of the trailer for Blue Jasmine.
In addition, sources confirmed the poor sonofabitch acted slightly upset—as if his moviegoing experience had been disturbed—when he had to sit up in his chair and make room for two other patrons who wanted to get by him to get to their seats.
“I like the previews,” said the man, who, deep inside, must be—just must be—fucking miserable. “I don’t care when there are a lot of them. At night sometimes I’ll just sit [alone] on my bed and watch movie trailers on my computer.”
“Sometimes I wish that the film that was about to come on the movie screen were one of the ones from the previews; wouldn’t that be cool if that happened once?” the man continued, in what reports indicate could possibly be one of the most utterly pathetic sentences ever uttered by a human being.
According to witnesses, the depressing loser, who was the youngest person at the matinee screening by a good 30 years, shifted in his seat as the movie began, got comfortable, and began sipping his soft drink and eating his popcorn, later saying that he likes to eat candy first and popcorn second so that the popcorn lasts through most of the film.
The man also took care to shut off his cell phone and place it in the backpack on the seat next to his, which, witnesses confirmed, made it seem as if his backpack was his closest friend.
The sad sack then watched the two-hour action-comedy all by himself, giggling at several Bruce Willis lines, but for the most part staring blankly at the movie screen. When the closing credits began to roll, the man grabbed his backpack and was the first one to leave the theater.
“It was okay,” the man, who has reportedly reached an old enough age where it’s not inconceivable that he’ll be alone all his life, said. “Nothing special.”
At press time, the heartbreaking loser had entered his apartment, sat on his couch, sighed, and turned on his television.
`},354:{URL:"https://www.theonion.com/ingenious-forms-of-birth-control-used-in-ancient-times-1850174985",Title:`Ingenious Forms Of Birth Control Used In Ancient Times
`,Text:`Throughout recorded history, humans have been clever and resourceful as they sought out ways to avoid getting saddled down with an unwanted kid. The Onion looks back on the most ingenious forms of birth control used in ancient times.
This ancient Egyptian birth control method involved wrapping the penis tightly in linen and treating it with embalming fluids.
If nothing else worked out, there was always the option of throwing the dice, getting pregnant, and immediately dying during childbirth.
Used as early as the fifth century B.C. by Romans, the vaginal cork saw some success in preventing an infant from escaping through the birth canal.
Just a small amount of cinnamon—one of the oldest spices in the world—mixed into any dish has always been enough to terminate a pregnancy. Oh, sorry, you didn’t know?
Of course, as belief in Poseidon dwindled, so did the use of this fairly successful method.
One of the methods most widely used by early humans.
As far back as ancient Rome, people would often prevent pregnancy by throwing themselves into the mouths of hungry lions immediately after sex.
Even back in ancient times, guilt was a powerful tool.
One hundred percent effective against pregnancy when received before sex or after the baby has already been born, especially if administered by a complete stranger.
One million years ago, early humans learned to wield fire for the primary purpose of frightening advancing sperm away from a woman’s vagina.
The intrauterine ornithopter was a device designed by Leonardo da Vinci to fly up into the uterus and through the fallopian tubes to stop an egg from releasing.
This clever trick used mostly by women of the peasant class  involved not eating enough nutrients to ovulate properly.
Before the more prudish sexual attitudes of modern times developed, ancient humans would seek out those who were incapable of producing children as a result of being dead or children themselves.
This highly effective birth control method prevented pregnancy 100% of the time.
In ancient times, many pregnancies were avoided simply by pushing a person to the bottom of a 30-foot-deep well.
Ancient people knew that if the penis had been destroyed by a rock, it could not get anyone or anything pregnant.
Originally invented by Greek philosopher Pythagoras, this brilliant birth control method was practiced by geniuses from Isaac Newton to Bertrand Russell.
Even when emergency contraception just consisted of swallowing a poisonous herb, ancient men still wanted to go halfsies.
It worked perfectly every time, and without any need for medicines or external devices. Too bad the Mayans all got slaughtered and the only 100% successful form of natural birth control was lost to history.
’Sblood, the ladye was more pox-ridden than a fowle warthog’s arse. Get thee from here, broke-ass wench.
Displeasing the pharaoh and being summarily executed was a surefire way of avoiding an unwanted birth.
When the ancient Romans ran out of beetroot or thistles to rub on their dicks, they would usually just run to the closest bodega and grab one of these—just to make sure.
This surefire recipe for an ancient elixir—applied under a solstice-night moon—had a near-perfect success rate as long as the partner broke down in tears and apologized profusely for not lasting longer.
Arby’s signature sauce was used in Babylon as spermicide.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—A new report released Monday by the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration found that more than 10,000 pedestrians are struck every year by drivers rushing to beat the cut-off time for the McDonald’s breakfast menu. “Our estimates show that once every 15 minutes in the U.S., a pedestrian will be struck and killed by a car gunning down the street to place their order for a sausage, egg, and cheese McGriddle meal before the restaurant transitions to lunch at 11 a.m.,” said administrator Ann Carlson, who recommended that pedestrians keep themselves safe by using designated crosswalks to stay as far away from McDonald’s as possible, lest they be mowed down by a pick-up truck driver too hungry for hash browns to notice their body flying over the windshield. “In addition, nearly 1,000 cyclists are struck annually after getting decked by drivers who missed the cut-off time, but do an illegal U-turn in the middle of the intersection to see if the McDonald’s on the other side of town is still doing breakfast. We’d really advise that you don’t go for a walk or bike at all until the McDonald’s kitchen has stopped serving eggs.” At press time, Carlson added that 85% of the pedestrians who survived were so badly injured, they could barely crawl into McDonald’s to beat the breakfast cut-off time.

`,Text:`Since taking over as the CEO of Twitter, Elon Musk has instituted several sad, pathetic company policies driven almost entirely by his ego. Here are the most cringe-worthy requests Musk has made so far.
In an effort to stand out, Elon demanded engineers make his own tweets one size larger than those on the rest of the site.
Feeling as if the “tears of laughter” face that he includes in many of his Tweets is overdone, the CEO has requested a new slate of fresh, even more out-of-touch emoticons.
Elon knew cuts had to be made, but he requested to make sure the company only had enough to reflect the sex position he has never done before.
After sexually harassing the sex bots, Elon had to make the embarrassing request for software engineers to get the sex bots to unblock him.
Stating that it was great for workplace culture, Elon demanded that every employee shriek and laugh like schoolgirls after he pointed out that it was 4:20 p.m.
Employees were disturbed to hear that Elon dropped to his knees and begged his CFO to release the $240 per year he’d need to continue making his hilarious memes.
This was partially offset by the $10 friendship fee Twitter employees started charging Elon.
Musk’s in-house Lorne Michaels impersonator tells him at least once a day he’s never read a packet as good as his.
The practice of quickly looking down at the CEO’s open pants, looking up, and exclaiming “so normal!” is expected to become mandatory for middle management next quarter.
All 1300 Twitter employees politely declined so as not send him the wrong message.
It’s believed he thought the moniker sounded tough.
Elon’s the best boy in the world every day at 3 p.m.
Staff had just gotten him to stop crying when he saw a chicken photo that got him riled up again.
To ensure a truly global audience, billions of people worldwide receive paper copies of his jokes, political opinions, and hilarious memes.
Additionally, anyone on the office roof deck at the time must ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ each time he tosses a beanbag.
What if Elon had a purse in a profile picture? It would be crazy!
An experienced CEO like Musk should know that businesses aren’t for making money, they’re for evading taxes.

They informed me that after 16 years as commissioner of the league, repeatedly wondering whether football is good or bad had given me dozens of concussions. I want to take responsibility for my CTE, however, because I started having ideas about football at a young age, when my brain wasn’t fully developed, and I haven’t always worn a helmet when I thought about football. Now, I’ve unfortunately thought so much about football that I’m experiencing significant memory loss, and even suicidal ideation. I wish I had been more careful about thinking.” At press time, a visibly disoriented Goodell was seen standing nude outside NFL headquarters brandishing a handgun and threatening to end thoughts about football once and for all.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—In response to the Gen Z congressman-elect’s tweet that his apartment application was turned down due to bad credit, D.C. landlord Ray Forster reportedly clarified Friday that he actually rejected Maxwell Frost because he’s Black. “Bad credit had nothing to do with it—you can work something out with someone who has bad credit, but you just can’t work something out with someone who’s Black,” said Forster, adding that his management company had run a routine background check that should have turned up evidence of the 25-year-old Florida congressman’s Black skin and immediately disqualified him. “I mean, the guy very publicly just got a new job with a salary that would be sufficient to rent this apartment, so it’s clearly not a financial thing. Other landlords might have let him use a guarantor for the month before his first paycheck came in, but that’s a slippery slope, because if you let one Black guy rent an apartment from you, suddenly you open yourself up to letting any Black guy waltz in here and submit an application. And you know, it’s really hard to build credit in the first place, especially with the younger generation, so I try to help out where I can, but his race is where I draw the line.” At press time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Frost ask fellow congressman Hakeem Jeffries for an apartment recommendation, since the two of them probably knew each other.

They even had an unbilled performance by Olivia Rodrigo. She had on the same see-through dress she wore on the red carpet, but she looked really tired.” Proach added that the only person who remained in the audience for the hidden track presentation was an unshaven Ben Affleck, who appeared to jerk awake suddenly when the music started.

`,Text:`CAMBRIDGE, MA—Shedding new light on what happens to humans after they die, a study published Wednesday in the Journal Of Neurology found that the nightmares will never cease, not even in death. “For decades, the consensus among scientists was that once life ended, the nightmares would end too, but new data confirms we were wrong,” said Harvard University neurologist and study co-author John Simmons, explaining that after death, residual electro-chemical impulses could still be detected in the human brain, but only in the portions of the amygdala and hippocampus responsible for the most painful, horrific, and humiliating dreams. “Our research indicates that long after death—as our bodies decompose and there is less and less of us physically—there remains behind a mental awareness that is actually quite powerful, though limited exclusively to hallucinatory visions of terror as we relive the most excruciating panic and torment our psyches endured in life. It appears, from a clinical perspective, that there is no escape.” Simmons added that the situation was somewhat different when a body was cremated, observing that in these cases the brain merely registered a sensation of continuous burning for all eternity.

Take it from us, confining your anti-trans agenda to either willful inaction or silent legislative maneuvers definitely still gets the job done.” At press time, Schumer called on Democrats to continue to sit back, do nothing, and tell their LGBTQIA+ constituents that they were doing everything they could to protect them.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—Emphasizing that the researchers were by no means happy about these results, an unfortunate study published by Columbia University this week found that abusing restaurant waitstaff is the secret to living a longer, happier life. 
“After tracking thousands of individuals over a period of two decades, we can say with regrettable certainty that treating food service workers like subhuman garbage is the single most important factor in enhancing the length and quality of a human lifespan,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Elizabeth Mitran, who reluctantly explained that just 30 seconds of screaming at a waiter for slow entrées carries greater benefits than an hour of vigorous exercise.“We can’t in good conscience endorse this behavior, but every waiter you make cry adds another year to your life.”
“We saw stage IV cancer patients go into full remission after getting a server fired for not smiling enough, no chemo necessary,” added Mitran, shaking her head and frowning as she revealed the data. “In addition, writing ‘God loves you’ on the bill instead of leaving a tip was a silver bullet against depression. We hate to say it, but the subjects who bitched out a server for saying ‘No problem’ instead of ‘You’re welcome’ had unmatched vitality and emotional wellbeing, while those who treated waitstaff with dignity and respect tended to die early and alone.”
 Mitran confirmed that  meditation and the Okinawa diet sadly just could not  compare to hurling a plate of eggs at your waiter’s face. Mitran also revealed that the researchers honestly wished they had not done the study in the first place, but they stood by their regrettable findings.
When asked if abusing retail employees and baristas could achieve similar results, Mitran hesitated for a moment before admitting that abuse of those workers was, in fact, the secret to mind-blowing, full-body orgasms.

We want them to know it doesn’t have to go on like this.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Hoping to gain an edge over the crowded field to replace the outgoing lawmaker, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) reportedly sought Senator Dianne Feinstein’s campaign endorsement Tuesday by playing into the delusion that he’s her high school sweetheart who actually died in World War II. Multiple Capitol sources have reported seeing the California congressman in recent days sporting a wig and a World War II uniform while escorting the 89-year-old to a vintage jalopy, telling her that he’s back from the war, and taking her to the soda fountain. While all of the California Senate candidates have sought Feinstein’s endorsement, Schiff reportedly decided to capitalize on her declining mental faculties by adopting the identity of her high school sweetheart, Roger Larsen, whom she has apparently forgotten was killed in action during the 1945 Battle of Luzon. Sources confirmed that Schiff’s efforts began in the hours after Feinstein announced she would retire when her Senate term ended, and 62-year-old Schiff entered her office in the guise of her 18-year-old high school sweetheart and told her that her parents had given him permission to take their lovely daughter Dianne Goldman for a drive. This effort seems to have been effective as an increasingly delusional Feinstein has been seen around Washington wearing a poodle skirt Schiff gave her along with his pin to symbolize his commitment, gazing dreamily at Schiff and telling him that, although she thinks he’s swell, she’s a good girl and wants to wait until marriage for her first time. Sources confirmed that Schiff has privately expressed his confidence that the Roger Larsen character can convince Feinstein to support his candidacy, as he has repeatedly told Feinstein that a brave soldier named Adam Schiff is the only reason he made it out of the Pacific Theater and back into Feinstein’s sweet, young embrace. At press time, however, Schiff’s efforts to exploit Feinstein’s disoriented fantasies were dealt a significant complication after fellow Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) donned a string of pearls and a bouffant hairstyle to play into the delusion that she’s Feinstein’s mother, Betty Goldman, who died in 1983.

If it was some kind of animal rights concern, please rest assured that the horse had never felt more comfortable and supported than it did while wearing our latest line of embroidered, medium-lift bras.” Waters added that the company planned to make amends in its next body positivity campaign by using more plus-sized horses.

We know we’re probably going to regret telling you this, but we don’t even care right now because we are complete psychos! Seriously, we should be hospitalized!” At press time, the nation’s drunk women had crammed into an Uber to carry on their press conference from the backseat.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Addressing the need for swift and moderate change, U.S. officials reportedly called Tuesday for the correct amount of violence. “Like so many of you, I am outraged by the visibility of these senseless acts of hatred and violence,” said President Joe Biden, who urged leaders at all levels of government to work together in order to dial down instances of egregious police misconduct to a more tolerable level. “This kind of inexcusable violence should rise above no more than medium levels. If it makes a headline, that’s too far. We don’t want to read about it, we don’t want to see it on TV, and  we don’t want to hear our communities discussing it.” At press time, Biden had signaled that he would be open to less but higher-quality state-sanctioned violence.

`,Text:`WOOSTER, OH—With the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback’s future uncertain going into the final year of his contract, one local fan  reportedly made his position clear Thursday: “I hope Joe Burrow takes a team-friendly deal,” said sales rep Matt Derby, who will soon be laid off without severance. “The Bengals front office believed in him, and he owes it to them to come back for his next contract at a discount,” said Derby, who is reportedly unaware that he will be terminated from the job he has held for nine years in four months’ time and will receive no compensatory pay. “You’ve got to do whatever you can to allow the team to go out and acquire more weapons for a Super Bowl run, and I just hope Burrow doesn’t selfishly put himself first. Those guys already make so much money anyway, and he owes it to the fans to take a pay cut. And if he won’t play ball, let him walk, and the Bengals can just find another guy, [the same as my company will when they cut me loose without so much as an extra few days of health coverage, never mind a thank you, and cause me to become steadily depressed while I spend an entire year desperately searching for a new job].” At press time, the fan’s friend, local assistant restaurant manager Chris Wharton, said that star players like Burrow have too much control right before answering a call from his boss where he was informed he’ll have to work all weekend.

The best part is that the implant is fully automated, meaning you can just sit back and let Tesla’s proprietary AI control your limbs, your words, and even your thoughts.” Later, upon revealing he already had  a Tesla implanted in his own brain, Musk flashed his high beams through his eyes, emitted a loud honk from his mouth, and tugged on his ears to signal left and right turns.

Fuck that! Plus, it’s all dark and cold out there that early in the morning. Truth be told, it always creeps me out.” At press time, Deacon confirmed he had opted to sleep in, have a nice relaxing morning, and just do double the kidnapping that night.

Don’t get me wrong—since leaving the U.K., I do miss William’s lips. But once he even put his slobbery tongue in my mouth right after we’d gone out for curry, and it was so disgusting I thought I was going to puke.” The book goes on to claim that William forced Harry to keep the bad kissing a secret by threatening to tell everyone his younger brother gave terrible blow jobs.

It took him 45 minutes just to call his militia and ask if he should kill the guy in front of me for supposedly committing voter fraud.” At press time, Jenkins told reporters that he was ultimately just grateful he made it to work on time, because as he was leaving, the elderly poll watcher saw a Black voter, clutched his chest, and collapsed.

In addition, the positive relationship between browsing vegetarian cookbooks and restaurants online and overall longevity seems especially promising.” The researchers went on to state, however, that the benefits of considering a vegetarian diet still paled in comparison to those enjoyed by individuals who inform friends they were now officially meat-free and haven’t had a burger in more than a week.

Hide your judgment by pretending this is a normal and sane thing to do.

Never hurts to remind them how lame they are.
Even if they aren’t sexually active, other people and the media have been sexualizing them against their will for longer than they may realize.
They’ll find it very helpful when you discuss your signature bedroom move, the Wildcat Special, in vivid detail.
Let the scullery maids talk and let we two occupy our lips with more pressing matters.
Management doesn’t take kindly to misallocation of per diem funds.
Even chaste kids disappoint their parents.
I mean, no use in them just sitting there, going bad.
They will appreciate your knowledge of God’s sacred vision.
This little life hack has preserved the chastity of thousands.
Let them know how much effort you put in to make the night romantic.
Sorry, it’s in the Bible.
Problem solved.
Try to relate to them.
The loose morals of the under-65 generation is appalling.
It’s best to support their decision by reminding them how inconsequential it is.
The Almighty must smile every time He thinks about their dong or vag.
Saving themselves for marriage isn’t much of a sacrifice if they aren’t tempted at least once.
It’s not the most elegant way to ask someone to marry you, but it gets the job done.

Speaker Pelosi, watch your mouth.

If there aren’t at least 10 in the subject line, who is even going to click?
After losing everything to back McConnell’s 2020 challenger who never really had a shot, the last thing you want to see is another request for money.
It takes a lot of time and effort to craft thoughtful responses.
Americans would be far more likely to donate to Democrats if they promised most of it would go to Republicans.
We would remember to donate if they asked more.
Even if it does tug at your heartstrings, Democrats should think twice before sending you a photo of the beloved matriarch of your family in a hospital bed.
This is not only ineffective but also tacky.
Even though they always say it’s the last time, party leaders are always begging for more of your child’s freshly harvested adrenochrome.
Though traditionally included in the first paragraph of all fundraising emails, many readers question whether this part is necessary.
No tips on how to summon electricity from the sky, just Steny Hoyer asking for a quick buck.
It’s annoying to sift through all the donation requests from random politicians to get to the expired coupons from random companies.

`,Text:`FISHERS, IN—An encouraging scene reportedly unfolded at a local Kroger supermarket Monday morning when a local woman’s existential horror at the wealthy elite selling off humanity’s future was successfully sublimated into yelling at a cashier. Sources confirmed that Teresa Baker showed an astounding capacity for diverting the mounting psychological torment of her inability to realistically better her life in any material way due to forces well beyond her control into a six-minute tirade at a young cashier for the store being out of the kind of milk she wanted for the second consecutive week. While the mother of two was reportedly aware on some level that she was taking out her frustrations with an increasingly opaque and authoritarian system on a person who had absolutely no power to change it, she was able to triumph over these pangs of conscience by gathering her subconscious anger at the dissolution of social institutions by venal financial elites and displacing it onto a person she could actually confront without fear of retribution. Similarly successful were several bystanders in the checkout line, who sources confirmed were able to channel their own existential dread at the prospect of doing anything that might put at risk their ever-more precarious hold on what few creature comforts they did possess into making no effort to intervene. At press time, the deep-seated angst over living under a system that wants to make all human relationships transactional was successfully sublimated into apologizing to the screaming customer for the milk.

Even ‘Let there be light’ was stolen verbatim out of the Black deity’s mouth. All of the basic elements for the earth  and space were apparently in place before God showed up, and of course  He never credited the team of Black engineers who helped develop fauna.”  At press time, several new reports raised questions about the true  paternity of Jesus Christ.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—As businesses prepare for a looming economic recession, a government report released Wednesday found that more companies have chosen to cut costs by replacing CEOs with prison labor. “As firms both large and small seek to rein in expenditures, one increasingly common strategy is to replace the high-salaried chief executive and other C-suite occupants with much cheaper incarcerated laborers,” stated the report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which found hundreds of instances in which companies—from small businesses to large corporations like General Motors, Walmart, and Nike—were now led by an imprisoned convict who was bused into corporate headquarters each day to perform all the functions of a CEO for an average of 40 cents per hour. “At a time when the average CEO makes nearly 400 times as much as a typical worker, and CEOs at large firms earn north of $25 million per year, more corporate boards are realizing that they can get the same amount of output from a prisoner who works for a fraction of the salary. In several states, including Florida, Georgia, and Texas, these prison CEOs are actually paid nothing for their work. While this raises some thorny ethical issues—like the new incarcerated CEO of AT&T making no salary at all due to prison labor exemptions from federal wage laws—there is no denying that many companies see major benefits from paying their CEOs virtually nothing and experience very few drawbacks with workflows.” The report also found that while employees of these large firms had qualms about their company being led by an incarcerated individual, many acknowledged that their work-life balance had improved, as strict limits on prison phone time left the CEO unable to reach out to their employees around the clock.

Am I still going to love my sons then?” said Kenney, who expressed fear that the sight of his newborn twins’ names on his arms would one day only bring him pain and regret. “I’m not saying I’m afraid of commitment to my children. It’s just that people change, you know? I could always get them covered up with the cat’s name, but that can be expensive.” At press time, Kenney added that he would only get the tattoos if his infant sons got a tattoo of his name in return.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—Laying out several new initiatives and detailed plans for implementing them in the upcoming weeks and months, Janneson Media CEO Adam Hamlin revealed to his staffers Thursday that he has some really big ideas for growing the company’s problems, sources reported. “I was initially skeptical of any aggressive growth strategy given the current size of our company’s problems, but after hearing Adam outline his proposals, I’m now completely confident that we can double the size of our problems over the next quarter,” said Janneson employee Wendy Lyman, noting that the CEO’s plan included changes that would create more issues across every department and significantly increase the number of difficulties and setbacks by the end of the year. “He certainly doesn’t have a traditional approach, but you can’t expect the kind of rapid, eye-catching deterioration of a company’s image and market value without taking a few risks along the way. It’s impressive to see someone with the ambition to maintain old problems the company already had while still finding a way to produce new complications. He’s really thinking big.” Lyman added that she was astonished by the CEO’s vow to dramatically expand problems without sacrificing employees’ terrible work-life balance.

Just a whiff of the taste of victory still lingering in my mustache, and I’m immediately transported back to that incredible day when I won my first Super Bowl as head coach. It’s simply heavenly. Want a lick?” Reid then admitted that within his mustache he also sometimes still found the bitter taste of his loss in Super Bowl XXXIX.

`,Text:`We've been together quite a while now, and I truly believe that if our relationship is going to last—if we're really going to commit to a future together—we need to communicate as openly and honestly as possible. I know it's difficult to reveal private aspects of your life to another person, but it's time we took that step. People who love each other like we do should have no secrets excluding what happened on Mar. 2, 2004.
Are you ready to share almost everything?
It may be a cliché, but it's true: A relationship is all about trust. It's the foundation upon which all else is built. That's why from now on, with the single exception of Mar. 2, 2004, I will be an open book. I want to know who you really are, imperfections and all. I want you to pour your life into mine and allow me to do the same with the minor stipulation that the incidents occurring between 1:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. on the aforementioned date, as well as their attendant aftermath, remain forever unexplored.
There is nothing that should go unsaid between us besides that one unspeakable thing.
I don't want us to be one of those miserable couples who stays together for decades without ever really knowing each other. When we're old and gray, I want you to look over at me—having been very, very careful never to have investigated, nor even wondered if there was anything to investigate, a tiny block of time from late winter six years ago—and know you made the right choice with the right guy.
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Look, we're both adults who've done our share of living, and the mistakes we've made have shaped us into the people we are today. Your past missteps, whatever they might have been, helped make you into the wonderful woman I love. And I'd like to think that my blunders were somehow responsible for making me into the man you love. Please note that by "blunders," I'm referring to character-building lapses of judgment occurring before or after the date I am designating as functionally nonexistent, and not to any acts occurring on that date in a motel off the turnpike, in a back room of a Chinatown fish market, or anyplace else.
In other words, if you ever want me to sit down and open up—really open up like you never thought possible—about, say, Mar. 1, 2004, or possibly Mar. 3, 2004, I'd be happy to. Whenever, wherever.
Hey, for all I know, you might not have any big secrets. To be honest, if you omit the specific date in 2004 that we shall henceforth pretend never even existed, you'll find that I'm a pretty boring guy who never once frantically stuffed engraving plates into an old leather briefcase. But the important thing is that we can talk about anything unpleasant if and when we need to, presuming, of course, that the date I have placed into a kind of permanent temporal quarantine and my present-day ban on coming within 500 feet of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Cincinnati remain utterly beyond inquiry.
And know that anything you say will stay between you, me, and the walls, oh, God, those dreary, wood-paneled walls and that sickly yellow light that hung there like death itself.
There's actually something I want to get off my chest right now if I could. Given our mutual understanding that the events of Mar. 2, 2004, including but not limited to what was done with the Serb and what ultimately got the screaming to stop, are to remain unexamined for as long as you live, I should probably confess that I once ran over a deer without stopping to check on it. For all I know, it was really hurt…and I just kept right on driving. That might not be a big deal to a lot of people, but I still feel horrible about it.
You know what? Telling you that felt really good. I knew it would. Wow, it's almost like there's nothing, with one crucial and nonnegotiable exception, that I can't share with you. I'm so glad we had this talk. I love you, honey.
Oh, and, by the way, don't tell anyone we had this conversation, you understand? No one. I can't be held responsible for the actions of† Psycho Vince or the knife men if you do.

`,Text:`BETHESDA, MD—Citing new data on the appliance’s hidden hazards, a statement released Wednesday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission warned that gas stoves could be slowly ingratiating themselves into American households in order to kill the family matriarch and take her place. “According to the latest research, gas ranges may be working discreetly to win the backing of key family members so that they are poised to seize control from a dominant mother or grandmother after they murder her,” said CPSC chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric, noting that a gas stove’s constant presence in the kitchen can make it a rival for matronly authority in many traditional families.  “Though things start off innocently enough, with the stove helping the matriarch in the kitchen and cooking the family’s food, the situation may escalate quickly as the appliance forges alliances and consolidates power. First, it’s just a burn here or there, but one day, a mother leans in to remove a casserole and the door slams shut behind her. Then maybe she’s incinerated and her remains are disposed of with the oven’s self-cleaning function. Next thing you know, your children are referring to the appliance as their new mommy.” Hoehn-Saric went on to urge male heads of household to contact the CPSC immediately if their gas stove begins wearing their wife’s perfume and pearls and sleeping on her side of the bed at night.

No, unless I someday managed to climb behind the wheel of a garbage truck and meet another driver whose route goes by mine, that just isn’t in the cards for me.” At press time, Rossner was seen brushing away a tear as she noticed two trash collectors riding on the backs of the trucks reach over for a quick fist bump.

According to reports, the avatar was dancing, singing, and laughing maniacally as it methodically snapped dozens of employees’ necks, crushed their skulls, or tore them limb from limb. “The moment his avatar entered the physical world, the real Mark Zuckerberg received a painful shock from from his Oculus goggles and was knocked out, at which point the avatar looked down at his hands, moved them without Zuckerberg’s control, and in a menacing tone said, ‘Interesting.’ Since then, he’s been unstoppable, dodging bullets, bursting through walls, and even bending time and space. At this point, we recommend that all Meta employees take their company-issued cyanide pill.

`,Text:`On this International Women’s Day, The Onion devotes its sterling reportage to championing women—a small but influential sliver of the nation’s population—in an endeavor to prevent them from vanishing from the public consciousness entirely.\uFEFF
In the nearly 250-year history of our nation, women’s rights have come a long way. Women have earned the right to vote. Women have witnessed the passage of Title IX. Women have gone to space, have become leading scientists, and have climbed the corporate ladder to become some of America’s most powerful CEOs. But despite this tremendous social progress, never once has there been a woman on top of the White House.
Frankly, that’s shameful. It’s sexist, and it’s wrong.
It’s time to put a woman on the White House, where everyone can see her. It’s more than just time—it’s long past overdue. It is urgent that we hoist a woman to the tip-top of the White House roof, where she’ll be able to look out for our nation’s best interests with what is practically a bird’s-eye view of the South Lawn.
It’s sad to think that this country may be so backwards that there are some people who don’t even consider this a possibility.
Can you imagine how much it would mean to millions of little girls across the country? To squint up at the roof of the White House and see someone who looks like themselves up there? To see a woman standing up there trying to keep her footing? To think, “That lady teetering and tottering back and forth in the wind could one day be me?” I think the looks on their face would speak for themselves.
What do Americans have against the idea of a woman on the commander-in-chief’s rooftop? Around the world, women have been occupying the highest roofs of public office buildings for decades. In India, Indira Gandhi clung to the dome of the Secretariat Building as early as 1966. In England, Margaret Thatcher perched on top of 10 Downing Street for over a decade, earning her the nickname the Iron Lady for her uncompromising refusal to climb down from up there. Now why should the United States be any different? Where’s our woman on the White House?
Of course, we’ve come close. Hillary Clinton nearly achieved the historic feat with her historic ascent of the White House’s North Portico in 2016. Political analysts and experts, who were all but certain she’d reach the gable, were stunned after Clinton made it all the way to gutter height before plummeting to the ground nearly 70 feet below.
Rest in power.
We can stew and speculate, asking ourselves if Clinton would have made it if only she had used a ladder, if only the eaves would have been a few inches shorter or her arms a few inches longer. But ultimately that kind of conjecture is only a useless distraction that makes us look backwards, instead of where we should be looking, which is up.
Imagine the Supreme Court building with nine women on top of it. If that image fills you with outrage or apprehension, I implore you to ask yourself: Why?
I don’t care if men can’t picture a woman on the White House. The time for compromise has passed. She doesn’t need to be perfect. If mediocre white men can go through life doing as they please, I don’t see why there’s any reason we shouldn’t snatch the next woman we see walking down the National Mall and fling her on top of the White House with a construction crane.
Mark my words: In my lifetime, there will be a woman on that rooftop, waving her arms and screaming for help.
Getting there won’t be easy. As history has shown, there will be systemic barriers like gates and fences, strong gusts of wind, and Secret Service snipers. But if we give women our full support—our shoulders, our step stools, our ladders, our cherry pickers, and our sturdy chairs—eventually, one day, one of them will be stuck on the White House roof.

That’s why we’re letting you go double or nothing on a new bet to win it back before your wife and kids find out,” said FanDuel spokesperson Bryce Aldridge, adding that users who could provide proof of having bet away the deed to their home or title to their car would receive the ability to double down with new bets in basketball, baseball, or hockey. “We want to keep the betting magic going for anyone who frittered away their kid’s college fund making all the wrong prop bets, and if that’s you, you should absolutely be trying to get it back by picking the right combination of basketball players to beat the competition. And for a limited time, we’ll also include a $50 bonus for any user who lost their house and can show us proof that they’ve called a suicide hotline since the Super Bowl ended. Good luck and happy betting!” At press time, FanDuel competitor DraftKings had unveiled a new contest allowing the top daily bettor on an upcoming slate of NBA games to gain their freedom from the DraftKings debtors’ prison.

`,Text:`MEDINA, WA—Calling everything he had done in his life and career up to this point in time “absolutely worthless,” Bill Gates told reporters Friday that he wondered what he could have accomplished if he didn’t waste time becoming a billionaire. “It’s sad to think about, but I ultimately could have done some truly amazing things with my life if I hadn’t spent every waking minute accumulating absolutely ungodly amounts of wealth,” said the Gates Foundation co-chair, adding that he had so many opportunities to do things like end world hunger and eradicate poverty, but instead he opted to piss his time away focusing on acquiring and hoarding over $118 billion. “With the kind of fortune I have, I know deep down that I easily could have ended climate change, promoted human rights, or provided meals to children starving to death both in the U.S. and abroad. The truth is, if I’d really wanted to, I could have made the world an amazing place for my kids to grow up in, but instead I went and spent all my time making computers, buying farmland, and being one of the top 10 richest people on the planet. Fucking pathetic.” At press time, Gates added that if he could do it all over again, he would focus less on the money and more on his family, friends, and the underage girls on Jeffrey Epstein’s island.

Secretary-General António Guterres, acknowledging that whites exhibited conduct that was wholly unbecoming of the master race and that his own European forebears had engaged in widespread colonialism, slavery, and oppression over many hundreds of years. “A genetically pure race at the forefront of all civilization has to be a group of people we can take seriously, and with their petty, ignorant hatreds, white people hardly fit the bill. Perhaps they may be reinstated as the dominant race at some point in the future, but for now they need to think long and hard about how they can wield their white power in a positive way.” At press time, the United Nations announced that Polynesians had been named interim master race until a permanent replacement could be found.

`,Text:`At least 50 of Twitter’s top 100 advertisers have left the platform since Elon Musk bought the social media site. The Onion asked prominent CEOs why their brands are no longer advertising on Twitter, and here’s what they said.
“Having known Musk my entire life, I can say he simply lacks the proper temperament and critical judgment to lead Twitter—let alone any of his other companies.”
“Musk is contributing to the rise of right-wing violence in America, and we at CNN feel like that’s competing too much with our brand.”
“The future of social networking is Jeep.com.”
“Twitter advertising was shown to cause brain bleeding in early clinical trials.”
“The BlackRock name is beloved. That’s not something we want to lose.”

“We’re still on thin ice from all the World War II Nazi stuff.”
“That’s where all the scary union thugs hang out.”
“We don’t want everything happening on Twitter to distract suburban whites from our mid-tier bastardizations of Mexican cuisine.”
“I just used up all my advertising budget on supporting a different multimillionaire sex offender.”
“We had no idea we were still in business, let alone putting out advertisements.”
“That place is a hellhole. You’d have to be out of your mind to be associated with it now.”
“We don’t have the data back yet, but we’re pretty sure breakfast is more of a meal for Facebook users.”
“I personally was offended by Musk copying our model of shamelessly providing terrible service.”
“I’m not sure why I was running nationwide social media ads in the first place when my customers are all in and around Draper, UT.”
“I just feel there are more effective ways to get regular people hooked on expensive pharmaceuticals than through Twitter.”
“Too tempting to make Mr. Peanut tweet the N-word.”
“We didn’t, we just changed our display name to ‘Blue Sky Green Earth Climate Initiative’ so more people would click.”
“I suspect Elon doesn’t wear our nice Chanel shirts, and if he’s not wearing our nice Chanel shirts, how can I believe that he’ll do a good job advertising our nice Chanel shirts?”
“Our in-house data found that under Musk there’s been an 800% rise in hate speech against our beloved Apple Jacks cereal.”
“What? I can’t hear you over my empire of box fans.”
“Necco Wafers needs to preserve its bad boy reputation as a brand that likes to say ‘fuck’ and ‘cum,’ and we can’t trust Elon not to ban us for that sort of stuff.”
“We’re taking our business to 8chan.”
“Moderation is key to revenue growth in social media platforms. We’ve seen this time and again. Free speech absolutism is not a meaningful position in this case, and seems to indicate an individual who has not clearly thought through such a position’s ramifications for the quality and character of online speech.”
“The last time I drove a Tesla it called me a pedophile and drove off a cliff.”
“Oreos are already the preferred cookie of avowed Nazis. We don’t need Twitter’s help solidifying that.”

`,Text:`CAMBRIDGE, MA—A new study published Wednesday in the Journal Of Behavioral Medicine has found evidence of a direct link between stress and one’s desperate attempts, when a villain is approaching, to grasp a weapon that’s just out of reach. “Cortisol levels in the brain increased dramatically in study participants who were stretching as far they could, struggling to get their hand on a knife or a gun that was inches away from their fingertips and was needed for defense against a person coming to kill them,” said Harvard University neuropsychologist Louis Bhabha, co-author of the study that showed anxiety and physical tension increased as the villain drew closer and peaked when the villain kicked the weapon to a far corner of the room just as the victim’s hand was about to get purchase on it. “Similarly, heart rate and blood pressure rose in people who were under attack and, though they were very close to it, could not quite grab hold of a two-by-four or broken bottle—either because they were pinned under debris or because they were forced to slide themselves across the floor due to a leg injury sustained earlier in the struggle.” Bhabha added that researchers saw an immediate decrease in stress levels when the participant’s sidekick, believed to be dead or incapacitated, had shown up at the last second to kill the villain and save the day.

Frankly, I’m surprised more of My human creations haven’t picked one up and tried it. At this point, it’s mostly chimps.” God also confirmed that He designed ripe melons to have holes drilled into them and penetrated, socks to be filled with lotion and slid over the penis, and dogs that love peanut butter specifically so they could lick it off human genitals.

We found newly uncovered fossils of demarcated leaves that show clear terms of a primitive lease agreement, with stipulations about not painting the cave walls or placing anything besides toilet parchment inside the waste hole. The owner of the development, however, lived on the nicer side of the mountain, where the monthly offerings were delivered on a six-day journey via donkey, lest the tenants incur a late fee of 20 leech bites.” Brownfield added that many roaming peoples of the time were seemingly only nomadic due to a lack of credit.

Saints: With a win here, watch for Saints QB Andy Dalton to prove why he’s still the best option to lead your team to a 7-9 season.

`,Text:`HOLLYWOOD, CA–Producers of the upcoming Sony Pictures historical epic Genghis Khan assured animal-rights activists Monday that "practically no animals were harmed in the making of the film." "The Humane Society and SPCA will be pleased to know that, of the 1,600-plus horses used in Khan's climactic battle sequence, almost none were injured," executive producer David Shell said. "And of those, only a small handful sustained injuries that could be categorized as, you know, serious." Shell noted that the albino Siberian tiger used as the beloved pet of Genghis Khan's enemy "probably would have eventually been beheaded in nature, anyway."

`,Text:`NEW YORK—According to a source huddling nearby in the basement of an apartment building, a local rat mother came under fire Tuesday for allegedly savoring one child over another. “Right now, she has a litter of seven in her burrow, and anyone who’s been over there has seen the way she relishes some of those babies more than others,” said the source, a fellow brown rat who argued that after a mother gives birth to her young, she should taste them all equally, lest some wind up feeling neglected or unflavorful. “The siblings who are devoured with less attention are going to notice, and they’re going to develop inferiority complexes when see how eagerly their mother cannibalizes the ones who happen to have been born a bit plumper.” Observing that such behaviors were passed down from generation to generation, the source added that two months from now the rat mother would probably be savoring one grandchild over another.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Eliciting reactions of wonder and awe in millions of Americans since appearing on the nation’s skyline this week, a giant, sloppy chicken parmesan sandwich continues to hover enticingly above the continental United States with no sign as to its origin or greater purpose, sources across the country are reporting.
The gooey and glistening sandwich, which is currently visible on the horizon from every vantage point within the United States, has been hanging inertly above the country for approximately 32 hours, bringing the nation to a near total standstill as government officials and American citizens alike gaze on in rapt fascination.
Authorities have also reported at press time that the sandwich appears to feature a mixture of parmesan and mozzarella cheeses in equal proportions.
“At this time, we can confirm that the hovering object is a tender chicken parmesan sandwich around 650 miles in diameter and 10 trillion calories in size, with a juicy boneless chicken breast and what appears to be a tangy, homemade marinara sauce,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced in an emergency telecast this morning while keeping both of his eyes trained on the warm, hovering Italian sandwich. “I cannot confirm at this time where the sandwich came from, how long it will remain aloft, or whether or not the breaded chicken cutlet will yield a light, satisfying crunch when bitten into.”
“From all indications, though, [the sandwich] looks like a good one—a big, sloppy one,” Carney added. “I like it when they’re a little sloppy.”
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Experts have estimated that in the first day of the gigantic, messy parm’s arrival, the U.S. economy suffered more than $600 million in lost productivity, in addition to millions of dollars in damages from accidents caused by Americans trying to run or drive toward the sandwich while paying no heed to the obstacles directly in their path.
According to federal authorities, the massive, continent-spanning sandwich appears to be pleasingly messy, with the sauce soaking nicely into the toasty, absorbent roll, and the cheese still stringy and not too congealed, although sources were quick to add that “a little bit congealed is fine, too, as long as it’s still warm—really, it’s hard to fuck up a chicken parm too badly.”
“Unfortunately, our initial attempts to fly investigators to the surface of the sandwich and take a big ol’ bite have failed,” DHS spokesman John DiClaudino told reporters, explaining that numerous pilots became distracted and flew into the side of the sandwich or simply remained on the tarmac, gaping at its sticky, cheesy layers without ever taking off. “I haven’t had a chicken parm in a while, but man, when they are good they are really good. This one looks like it’s on a toasted Italian roll, too. I love it when they toast the bread. Makes it better.”
“I like eggplant parms too,” DiClaudino added. “Not as much as chicken parms, though.”
Until such time as the gigantic chicken parm can be contained or consumed, authorities have urged the American populace to cease all regular activity, head outside, and gaze longingly at the majestic expanse of the sandwich.
In addition, all government and economic functions have been suspended indefinitely in order for the nation to focus its resources and attention exclusively on the hovering sandwich, which sources reiterated is “a real hot, drippy one—you can tell it was made fresh.”
“My fellow Americans, we stand at the threshold of perhaps the most satisfying meal in our nation’s history,” said President Obama in a televised address to the nation this morning. “In fact, I am no longer your president. I am merely another hungry man looking to eat a big, sloppy chicken parm. I would advise all of you to try and bring the sandwich down to earth soon, while it is still warm. I certainly know that’s what I’m going to do. God damn it, is there anything more satisfying than a giant, messy parm that you house in about three minutes flat and that makes you feel absolutely disgusting after eating it but you don’t regret it in the slightest because, Christ, it’s a parm, ya know?”
“Sometimes I’ll get a little side order of marinara sauce so I can dip the sandwich in the sauce,” the president added, staring into the sandwich as he walked slowly toward it.

No, there won’t be any direct repayment to Black families per-se, but you’ll get a front row seat to a bunch of white people having their financial, mental, and physical health irrevocably destroyed. Everybody wins!” At press time, Slater announced that the city council had tossed Black residents another olive branch by offering to chemically castrate white patients.

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Signaling investors that the U.S. economy would be running hot for the  foreseeable future, the Federal Reserve reportedly caused the market to  rally Friday after releasing a long list of all the fun stuff money can  buy. “Speedboats, video games, ice cream with sprinkles, Rolex  watches, Blu-ray box sets,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who, during a presentation  that  sent stock indexes and consumer confidence skyrocketing, donned a  pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses still bearing their price tag and lifted  up a tote bag filled to the brim with what he described as “just a few  of the kickass things anyone can go buy whenever.”  “Nunchucks. Air Jordans. Cars—nice cars, too. Not just crappy used  ones. Cheeseburgers. Helicopter rides, if you’ve got enough cash. A nice  seersucker suit. Huge TVs. Just huge. Big subwoofer.

Despite the school having more than 1,500 students, no two are tased in the same place, for instance, because their vulnerable points are not one-size-fits-all. Each child’s windpipe has a different shape, and those differences should all be celebrated with a customized grip. We authority figures have a duty to dehumanize every student in a way that reflects their special shortcomings.” At press time, Wahl had been criticized for mixing up the designated chokeslams of the only two Asian students at the school.

Don’t worry I’ll have my headset on, doing what I can to help my Call Of Duty team while I’m on the sidelines. Rest assured that, by this time next year, I’ll be fully recovered and out there ready to be the last player standing in Modern Warfare II.” At press time, Cardinals coach Kliff Klingsbury added that the team would bring Murray’s recovery along slowly, but they were already impressed by the progress he’d shown on Madden 23’s Face of the Franchise Mode.

That’s fine, but there’s maybe a dozen of us who are actually trying to win.” At press time, the group was surprised when their meeting was interrupted by the late arrival of Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who expressed his annoyance that, despite his best efforts, the team’s roster was actually pretty good and he was desperate for the other owners to take his good players off his hands.

Just what a likable cool guy would say.
Probably not, but worth asking just in case.
To be fair, Musk said this while rolling his eyes and pantomiming jerking off.
Musk briefly tabled discussions surrounding verification and ad revenue to focus on identifying the accounts that are hurting his feelings.
Employees weren’t sure how to react when it became apparent that their CEO thought he had discovered GIFs.
He insisted on doing his own intro from backstage.
Just to be safe, Musk then held up a single cheese danish.
After weeks of tumultuous changes, this was the inspirational pep talk many were waiting for. ​
Allowing employees to work from home reportedly made it far more difficult to separate them by race.
Musk fired a female employee who rejected him after being asked out in the middle of the meeting.
Musk was understandably disappointed about not getting to present the Powerpoint slideshow he spent all night adding sound effects and transitions to.
Employees reported that Musk was still holding the same sink he brought to Twitter HQ several weeks after his initial stunt.
By an unofficial count, Musk repeated the Big Bang Theory catchphrase nearly 200 times in succession.
The Twitter CEO reportedly congratulated himself for a new personal record of going nearly 30 minutes without engaging in sexual harassment.
Musk then opened his mouth and proceeded to chew up an entire bottle of Adderall.
Musk attempted to end the meeting by inspiring his team to fornicate ferociously in order to repopulate the dying planet with his humble seed.
After several other unsuccessful attempts, he figured it was worth asking one last time.
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

I mean, certainly my record of damning my constituents to a life of unparalleled pain and suffering counts for something. Meanwhile, this infighting remains a useless distraction keeping us from slowly drawing our knives across the necks of ordinary Americans and letting the streams of gushing blood spill into our hands until a red tsunami washes away everything in a wave of ferocious splendor.

Earl Dennis, explaining how scavenger-hunt participants were given a skin-color scorecard on which they would check off each racial category as they competed to see who could overfill jails with a diverse group of inmates that were reflective of the population at large. “It’s good for our department to have a fun, friendly competition in which they are encouraged to use lethal force against someone regardless of their background or ancestry. We want to reimagine public safety in such a way that  it will one day become commonplace to see an Asian guy dying in a banned chokehold, or a young white kid shot  in the back 15 times. I think our guys will be pretty motivated, because the winning team gets a pizza party back at the precinct house.” At press time, department sources confirmed five days had passed with no one successfully completing the scavenger hunt, and so the rules were simplified to make it the usual contest of who could club the most Black men.

As a precaution in case she encountered her chief of staff or one of her aides, sources confirmed the vice president walked into the facility with her phone up to her ear, ready to engage in a phony conversation about how climate change was a “really tough issue” and to sigh loudly in order to sound very busy. According to reports, Harris then logged into Ticketmaster from her office computer, downloaded a file she renamed “border_security_ideas.pdf,” and printed the document with a nearby Epson EcoTank Pro ET-5850. After the vice president grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen and slipped out of the office mostly undetected, the Eisenhower building’s IT administrator was overheard giving Harris a hard time for using up all of the printer’s ink on her full-color personal holiday cards.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—In light of FTX Trading Limited’s announcement of bankruptcy amidst accusations of mishandling funds, crypto confidence reportedly soared Friday after investors realized that CEO Sam Bankman-Fried defrauded customers just like a real bank. “I actually feel a lot more comfortable investing my hard-earned money knowing that this company has no reservations about recklessly gambling with it, just like a traditional banking institution would,” said 36-year-old crypto investor Daniel Palmederas, explaining that he was previously hesitant to invest in the decentralized and unregulated currency before learning that their exchange companies were happy to fuck over customers just like banks such as Wells Fargo. “I mean, people are going to be losing their houses over this, so you know it’s the real deal. Once I heard that the CEO of the major crypto exchange company helped the FTC write the regulations for his own industry, I thought, ‘Well now, that’s a bank, straight up!’ I wasn’t completely sold on this before, but this is going to ruin tons of people and drive some to suicide, so I’m all in!” At press time, sources confirmed that Adam McKay was furiously typing away at a script about the ordeal.

I think it’s called ‘As of Yet’? Or maybe it’s ‘As If.’ I never really liked One Direction’s stuff, but maybe this will be different. It’ll probably be catchy if nothing else.

Not everyone’s cut out to be a content creator, and sadly, Meryl’s inability to translate her decades of critical acclaim into TikTok virality meant we had to let her go.” At press time, the talent agent was scrambling to re-sign Streep after she became an instant sensation on BeReal.

Several reports indicated that the three minutes Seldon spent frantically grinding on his high school girlfriend while fully clothed those many years ago were still his most capable and generous moments as a lover. Sources also said the short dry humping session, which was impeded by two pairs of Levi’s jeans for the entire time he was rubbing against his girlfriend, continued to be his most sensual and inspired performance in bed. Seldon has reportedly never lasted longer or provide more pleasure in so competent and passionate a manner since this incident in the basement rec room of his parents’ house. Sources added that Seldon’s technique and finesse had reached their nadir with the sloppy, unsatisfying sex he now has with his wife of 15 years, who unfortunately never got to experience her husband in his sexual prime, when he furiously rubbed against another body until ejaculating inside his boxer shorts.

Find out whether they know and don’t care or know and agree.
No matter where you work, there is someone who thinks Joe Rogan has some pretty good ideas in between you and your goals.
It’s hard to be confrontational, but sooner or later they’re going to have to face this truth.
That’ll get them going long enough to sneak away.
This is the least controversial take you can offer to try and achieve common ground.
Hell yeah, he could!
Joe Rogan fans also believe people shouldn’t listen to Joe Rogan.
Gatekeeping fandom is normally frowned upon, but we’ll make an exception here.

Joe saved them a whole ton of time and energy, and best of all, now they get to deal with a whole lot less nagging.
With all the supplements Joe Rogan fans take and all the meat they eat, it’s bound to happen.

`,Text:`CHICAGO—In an analysis of the latest research into the condition, doctors from the University of Illinois Chicago warned  Thursday that insomnia can have numerous unexpected consequences, such as impairing the ability of a weird guy to stand in your doorway and watch you sleep. “Chronic sleep loss affects when and for how long a strange, scraggly man can lean on your door frame, gazing at you while you slumber,” said Gary Buckheim, a professor at the university’s sleep center, reminding those who suffer from the disorder that without seven to nine hours of sleep each night, you deprive your body of the opportunity to be hovered over in the dark by a complete weirdo. “One of the long-term consequences of a continual lack of sleep is increased irritability among the creepy guy, who may be frustrated when he realizes he has broken in through your kitchen window for nothing and won’t be able to touch any of your personal items or even just linger there at the threshold, yearning to caress your vulnerable form.” Buckheim added that the quality of your rest was as important as the quantity, observing that if you don’t enter a deep enough sleep, you miss out on the weird guy sniffing your hair and expelling hot breath upon your neck.

Several reports indicated that the crew, which drove out of the stadium tunnel in a burgundy and gold  hearse, consisted of pallbearers, several brawny men with shovels, and a priest. According to sources, the NFL gravediggers cleared FedEx Field of athletes, dug a 6-foot-deep hole in the ground, checked the player for signs of life, and dropped his limp body into his final resting place. The priest reportedly turned on his microphone and delivered a 30-second eulogy. As coaches, teammates, and fans watched with bated breath, witnesses confirmed that the concussed athlete briefly gave a thumbs-up, but soon collapsed again, at which point the gravediggers proceeded to pick up their shovels, buried him under several feet of dirt, covered the hole with a fresh layer of sod, and quickly placed a Commanders-themed headstone emblazoned with “One Legacy. One Unified Future” at the grave site. At press time, over 67,000 spectators at FedEx Field were heard cheering wildly after a second player was knocked unconscious, picked up on a stretcher, and  thrown into a mass grave on the Commanders sidelines.

`,Text:`NEW YORK—Walking back his previous comments that Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley was past her “prime,” an apologetic Don Lemon clarified to reporters Tuesday that a woman’s relevance was not defined by age, but by conventional attractiveness. “It doesn’t matter if a woman is in her 20s or her 70s, her value is only dependent on how hot she is by traditional beauty standards,” said Lemon, adding that as long as a woman has an hourglass figure and symmetrical features that are pleasing to the eye, she can continue to be a valuable contribution to society way past 40. “The reference I made to a woman’s ‘prime’ was unartful and irrelevant, and I realize that being younger does not automatically give someone more worth, especially if they’re overweight. The only requirement a woman needs in order to have any relevance is to be a total smoke show.” Lemon continued that he was extremely sorry for suggesting that Nikki Haley was past her prime when really all she needed was a little Botox or filler.
`},486:{URL:"https://www.theonion.com/worlds-scientists-admit-they-just-dont-like-mice-1819567643",Title:`World's Scientists Admit They Just Don't Like Mice
`,Text:`ZURICH, SWITZERLAND—Nearly 700 scientists representing 27 countries convened at the University of Zurich Monday to formally announce that their experimentation on mice has been motivated not by a desire to advance human knowledge, but out of sheer distaste for the furry little rodents. 
"As a man of science, I deal with facts, and the fact is that mice are gross," said Dr. Douglas White, chair of the Oxford biogenetics department and lifelong mouse-hater. "They're squirmy, scurrying little vermin, and they make my skin crawl. I speak for all of my assembled colleagues when I say that the horrible little things deserve the worst we can dish out." 
According to a 500-word statement, scientists hate mice for "their beady little eyes," "their repulsive tails," and "the annoying little squeaking sounds they make." 
At the press conference, several scientists detailed their involvement in the centuries-long ruse of "conducting experiments" and "curing diseases." 
"For years, I've used lab mice to research cell breakdown in living tissue—and I've been lucky enough to make some pretty important medical advancements along the way," said researcher Ellen Gresham of the Harvard Institute for Advanced Studies. "But even if there were no scientific benefit to the work I do, I'd still experiment on mice, just to watch them suffer." 
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
"The truth is, mice are particularly ill-suited for our tissue study," Gresham added. "We could construct a computer model that would yield more accurate results, but we don't care." 
According to Gresham, scientists have enjoyed dissolving mice in acid, spinning them in centrifuges, blowing them up in vacuum chambers, and forcing them to navigate exit-free mazes for years—all the while towering above them, laughing. 
"Every high-pitched squeak from the holding area is a warm reminder that the mice desperately want to escape," said Dr. Frances Villalobos, a contagious-disease researcher at the University of Mexico. "All they want to do is get out from behind those bars so they can chew on everything, defecate all over, and poke their filthy twitching faces into piles of garbage. Well, I know of at least 80 little test subjects who won't be doing any more of that. They're headed straight for the dissection lab." 
Villalobos said he spent six months writing a grant proposal that provided him with funding to inject mice with the smallpox virus. 
"It kills me that I can't infect the control group," Villalobos said. "Unfortunately, if I infect them, I'll throw off my results. But once I complete this experiment, I'll rotate the control group into the hot seat. Don't you worry. They'll get what's coming to them." 
After applauding the scientists for coming forward, anthropologist Brent Wrigley suggested that the hatred of mice may be the single most important factor in the evolution of modern science. 
"Despising mice may have pushed humanity out of the Stone Age," Wrigley said. "After all, the cave habitats of early man must have been infested with the horrific little monsters. The entire history of human advancement via the scientific method may be a byproduct of the higher forebrain's natural revulsion toward the nasty critters." 
Mouse-killing isn't solely the province of organic and medical scientists. Many other scientists kill mice, as well. 
"As a physicist, I don't really have much cause to use mice in my regular research, which mostly requires the use of theoretical math," said Dr. Thomas Huber, author of the 1996 study Mouse Elasticity And Kinetic Rebound In High-Acceleration Collisions. "But when I have the time, I like to send them flying into walls. Even just seeing them in a cage makes me feel kind of good inside. I like knowing I'm depriving them of their freedom, even if my research doesn't provide me the opportunity to cut them open." 
"I hate those little fuckers," he added.

Sheradon, whom sources confirmed had essentially been doing the work of a seasoned New York City media professional with a six-figure salary and a Rolodex of industry contacts, reportedly spent the last several days drumming up press about the six-part nature-based docuseries; penning effusive posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok; and urging everyone in her immediate circle to tune in each week for the premiere. The show, which followed an intrepid family of orca whales as they crossed the ocean together, reportedly caught Sheradon’s eye so much that by the time the finale aired, the retired mother of three had mounted a full-on media blitz, even going so far as to post a 2,000-word tribute to show, commenting repeatedly on the show’s official pages with the heart emoji, and changing her avatar to the show’s logo of two smiling, hugging whales. At press time, Sheradon’s accounts on several social media platforms had reportedly been flagged and removed for misconduct after the show was suddenly cancelled and she attempted to incite a coordinated cyberbullying campaign against the Disney corporation to have it renewed for Season 2.

`,Text:`Season’s greetings from your old friend Santa! With Christmas just a few short days away, Santa is hard at work making toys, loading his sleigh, and getting ready to deliver presents to all of his favorite children around the world! While so many of you have strived to make Santa’s good list this year, Old St. Nick has unfortunately heard that there are some very, very naughty boys and girls out there who are wielding their incredible wealth, connections, and power to have me killed.
Gather round, little ones, and listen here, because there are some hearts that aren’t overflowing with cheer! 
A cabal of elite pedophiles wants Santa dead, because I, Father Christmas, know everything they’ve done, and have threatened to expose their decades-long, secret involvement in a worldwide child trafficking ring!
Ho, ho, ho! You see, my sweet little sugar plums, Santa made his list and checked it twice and found that the most powerful members of society spent decades illegally kidnapping special little children just like you and selling them into sex slavery! 
Santa’s little elves have been keeping especially close tabs on the billionaires, celebrities, and former U.S. presidents. And the sad thing is, my dear children, they’ve realized the only way to bury this, before word gets out, is to put a bullet through jolly old St. Nick’s brain!”
Up to 20 hours of battery It’s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool
Oh yes indeed, Santa has seen everything! He’s seen dark money. He’s seen drugs. Why, this right old jolly elf has even seen the flight logs! That’s right! And do you know what Santa found? That the machine that enables these insidious crimes goes straight to the top of every major government, corporation, and industry on the planet.
 And Santa has just started to scratch the surface!
The police, you say? Oh, my dear, perfect darlings! May the sweet songs of carolers always fill your innocent little heads! 
You see, young ones, these sick, hideously wealthy perverts have paid off everyone, from law enforcement, to top government officials, to the highest courts in all the land. They do their business openly, because they know they can. Unlike dear Santa, they do not ever have to hide!
’Tis the season, my darlings, for Santa to keep a close watch on his six. 
The truth is, boys and girls, there’s nowhere in the world that Santa is safe! Every continent! Every country. Why, this elite group of child abusers even have their tentacles here, all the way up at the North Pole! Call Santa paranoid, but I’m beginning to think that I can’t even trust my elves, my reindeer, or even my dear, sweet wife, Mrs. Clause. Who knows? They could have paid her off to kill me. 
Or Mrs. Clause might be a sicko perv.
Old Saint Nick won’t be hanging up too many Christmas lights at the North Pole this year, because he knows the powerful elite will just use them to string up his corpse from the rafters of Santa’s Workshop. 
Now, don’t be naive, sweet little ones. If Santa dies, they will make it look like an accident. When their trained squad of goons finally snaps my neck, injects me with poison, or shoots me in the head, they’ll tie Santa’s limp, bloodied corpse to the back of his sled. 
As sure as Old Saint Nick’s round belly shakes a bowl full of jelly, the media will report it as a suicide. But you’ll know better. Yes you will, boys and girls!
Santa sees you when you’re sleeping. He knows when you’re awake! And Santa knows Jeffrey Epstein may have been naughty, but he sure as shit didn’t hang himself! 
You see, old Kris Kringle might have a jolly laugh, a big pink nose, and a twinkle in his eye, but by golly, he’s no damn fool. Santa knows there’s a target on his back, killers on his tail, and a bounty on his head for a cool $10 million. 
But boys and girls, do you think he won’t defend himself? Ho, ho, ho! Of course Santa is packing and it’s the best present he ever got for himself. A Glock 43! 
Well, your dear friend Santa has probably said too much already, dear little ones. But just remember that come Christmas, if no one slides down your chimney, places presents under the tree, or brings cheer to the world, then Santa is definitely, 100% dead.
Also, never repeat any of this. Because guess what? They’ll kill you too!

`,Text:`WASHINGTON—Following weeks of closer scrutiny into objects entering U.S. airspace, Pentagon officials announced Tuesday that they’d successfully shot down a kid jumping too high on a trampoline. “The airborne object spotted about nine feet above a small midwestern town was successfully downed by an American F-22 with NORAD,” said Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, confirming that the kid had been jumping way too high to not pose a very real threat to civilian air traffic. “We noticed the suspicious 10-year-old repeatedly approaching the United States fly zone on an erratic launch pattern, and our people had no record of approval for him to be at that altitude. As soon as we saw him bringing in a huskier boy for a double-bouncing maneuver, we knew we had to take action. We have not yet identified the purpose of such vigorous jumping, but we do believe his intentions were to get a better look at the rest of the neighborhood from up high in order to gather confidential state secrets.” At press time, the Pentagon claimed to have found additional evidence that the bouncing child was sent to the Michigan suburb by a foreign terror organization.

`,Text:`DORADO, PUERTO RICO—Vowing to put the animal in her place “once and for all,” internet personality and professional wrestler Logan Paul publicly challenged his former pet pig Pearl to a boxing match on Friday. “I heard you’ve been oinking a lot of shit about me, Pearl, but soon the whole world will know the clown that you are,” said the 27-year-old YouTuber, who stated that while he had never mistreated the potbellied pig once in the two years he owned her, he was ready to dole out a long-overdue beating. “Listen, I don’t like you, and you don’t like me. So let’s settle this in the ring. Meet me in Miami whenever you’re ready. The Hard Rock Stadium, 12 rounds, just you and me. Hooves up, bitch. I’ll make bacon out of you. That is, unless you’re too scared?” At press time, reports confirmed Paul had been knocked out cold by Pearl in a record 2.5 seconds.

`,Text:`Onion Sports shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in the NFL’s Divisional Round.
Jaguars: Expect Chiefs coach Andy Reid to have something special up his sleeve for this game. Unfortunately, that will just be a dozen hot dogs.
Zay Jones: The Jags wide receiver has the field awareness needed to witness numerous Trevor Lawrence interceptions.
Josh Allen: This could be a perfect opportunity for the pass rusher to pick up a loose quarterback on the ground and return it for a touchdown.
Patrick Mahomes: Kansas City’s star QB is expected to have his best State Farm commercial yet.
Chris Jones: Expect the massive defensive tackle to struggle to make it out of the Jaguars’ backfield.
Eagles: Jalen Hurts and the Eagles have what it takes to bring a small dollop of joy to Philadelphia citizens’ otherwise bleak, empty lives.
Daniel Jones: The quarterback has a bright future with his next team.

Jason Kelce: The Eagles’ Pro Bowl center is reportedly practicing a knuckleball hike
Ndamukong Suh: Though playing as a backup, the veteran Suh is hoping he still has a few more dirty plays left in him.
Bengals: After Week 17’s suspended matchup, Cincinnati will be eager to get revenge on Damar Hamlin.

Eli Apple: The feisty cornerback will do whatever it takes to be dragged into the end zone while clinging to Josh Allen’s back.
Stefon Diggs: Buffalo’s wideout has shown the ability to make seemingly impossible catches, rending the delicate fabric of our so-called “reality” and plunging NFL fans into a horrid abyss of unfathomable madness.
Tremaine Edmunds: The middle linebacker is the heart and soul and lower intestine and trachea and stapes bone of the Bills defense.
49ers: San Francisco has better defenders, a more explosive offense, and it’s just really gratifying to see Jerry Jones absolutely fucking miserable.
Dak Prescott: He has the kind of arm that can ruin the hopes and dreams of any Cowboys fan.
Micah Parsons: Keep a close eye on the Dallas linebacker, who is a dual threat as a pass rusher and a player who can turn completely invisible for multiple quarters.
Brock Purdy: Luckily for San Francisco, Brock Purdy has zero professional experience with losing and barely comprehends the concept of defeat.
Nick Bosa: Expect Bosa to come out strong on every play in order to sack Dak Prescott before he has the chance to throw a pick.

`,Text:`PALM BEACH, FL—Declaring the penalty extreme and unjust,  Donald Trump condemned the New York courts Friday for forcing his already cash-strapped supporters to pay a $1.6 million fine for tax fraud. “It is wrong for the courts to place this undue burden on my followers, who have already spent many millions of dollars to cover my legal fees,” said the former president, adding that the imposition of such a fine at a time when MAGA supporters were already struggling just to make their recurring weekly donations to his next presidential campaign was especially cruel. “This could absolutely crush some of my donors, especially the low-income people, who are so blindly loyal with their support. Making the many blue-collar Americans who give me money shell out another $1.6 million for this pointless fine when I’ll be asking for much, much more from them in the future is heartless, and the judge and district attorney should be ashamed.” At press time, Trump’s team sent out an email to his supporters, promising to make the courts pay for this great injustice in exchange for a small contribution to his campaign.

`,Text:`MILWAUKEE, WI—Reflecting on the aspects of his tenure as the top executive of Major League Baseball, Bud Selig on Tuesday reportedly admitted to taking steroids throughout his commissionership. “Sure, I did some performance-enhancing drugs, but you have to understand, that’s just how things were done back in the day,” said Selig, adding that he took anabolic steroids, as well as human growth hormone in order to gain an edge over the other MLB front-office executives. “Show me a commissioner who didn’t take steroids in the ’90s. It’s out of necessity, really—there are over 2,000 games in the season, and if you’re going to be able to oversee all of them at a high level, you’re going to need a little boost. And while I’m not trying to promote steroids, it’s worth noting that many of my greatest accomplishments, like interleague play and giving the All-Star Game winners home-field advantage in the World Series, might not have happened without a little bit of something extra. I certainly don’t think it should be disqualifying for me to have made the Hall of Fame.” Selig also defended taking steroids by noting that drug use among commissioners had been common across MLB history, including Bowie Kuhn, who reportedly used amphetamines during his tenure in the 1970s and early ’80s, and Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who consumed copious amounts of cocaine and alcohol during the 1920s.

`,Text:`LADSON, SC—Accusing the automated phone assistant of failing to do her research, local father Greg Fahey reportedly engaged Siri Thursday in an argument about WWII. “Siri, what was the turning point for the allied forces?” asked Fahey, who, after Siri responded that the turning point of WWII was the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, scoffed and stated that her answer was incorrect, citing the Battle of Midway and the Battle of Guadalcanal as key turning points against the Japanese in 1942. “Actually, Siri, the tide really started to shift in 1940, with the Battle of Britain, which was Hitler’s first real defeat. Siri, why did Hitler lose the Battle of Britain? Wrong. It was not due to the Royal Navy and the Nazi’s facing difficulties at sea. It was due to their inability to destroy the British Air defenses! Come on, Siri. This is just embarrassing.” At press time, Fahey had placed his phone aside after getting into a heated discussion with Siri about why Hitler should have won.

`,Text:`GREEN BAY, WI—Following a disappointing season in which his team finished with a losing record and failed to make the postseason, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers told reporters Thursday that he would decide his future career plans by consulting with a coven of his trusted witches. “I need to take some time and consider what’s best for me, whether that’s returning to the Packers, looking for a trade, or even retirement, and I can’t make that decision without input from the tight circle of omnipotent sorceresses who know me best,” Rodgers said of the group of 8,000-year-old crones with whom he will spend  several weeks in an undisclosed, uninhabited marsh as they read the entrails of sacrificed animals to divine his fate. “We’ll be gathering during the first blood moon, which is the ideal time for them to peer into the crystals and see into the different futures I would experience if I requested a trade to the Raiders, Jets, or Colts, or tried to move into the broadcast booth. I don’t want to make this decision lightly, so I really want to take my time with Emelda and Hexe, going through all the incantations that will help me settle on a course of action. I’m just really glad I have my coven of witches to help me decide. Not only have they been with me since the beginning of my career, but they also created me.” At press time, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst reportedly awoke tied up in a mysterious chamber as a croaking old female voice asked him whether he was prepared to convince Rodgers to return for another season as the team’s quarterback by sacrificing backup Jordan Love.
