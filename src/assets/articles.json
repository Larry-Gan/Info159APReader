        "Text": "ORLANDO, FL\u2014As part of an increase in programming aimed toward strengthening a relationship with a key demographic, a new Golf Channel show that debuted Tuesday night is reportedly just a 30-minute praising of the Saudi royals. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about how much good the House of Saud has done for the sport of golf, as well as for America and the world in general,\u201d Saudi Golf Today co-host Jimmy Roberts said as the latest praise from the golf world for the ruling family of Saudi Arabia scrolled in a ticker across the bottom of the stream. The veteran sportscaster went on to ask a panel of analysts to name their favorite thing about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \u201cIn addition to just being a bunch of really good, standup guys, the Saudis are true champions of golf. [Saudi Arabian public investment head] Yasir Al-Rumayyan and his top-notch team over there are absolutely committed to elevating the public profile and prestige of golf around the world, and it\u2019s really incredible to see what they\u2019ve done with their courses. You haven\u2019t played a true round of 18 holes until you\u2019ve played them at Royal Greens or Dirab. Stay tuned, because coming up in the next hour we\u2019ve got pictures of Saudi royal family members playing golf while a live studio audience applauds.\u201d Roberts added that he didn\u2019t want the show to shy away from controversial issues, so he wished to state the Golf Channel\u2019s official position that the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was well deserved. \n"

Szilagyi, who noted that obese children as young as 12 should set their sights immediately on winning superlatives such as \u201cclass clown\u201d or \u201cmost school spirit.\u201d \u201cEven small changes, like being 10% brassier in your day-to-day interactions, can make a world of difference. Health care providers should help these children brainstorm a list of potential catchphrases and adopt irreverent nicknames like \u2018Dump Truck.\u2019 Plus, working on your physical comedy skills, like slapping your belly, is a fun activity the whole family can enjoy.\u201d At press time, the academy was facing backlash from critics who argued the best approach was for these children to become wallflowers.\n"

Anyone over age 10 or so is just easier to hit. To be able to nail a kid in the head in the small gap between two desks is an incredibly impressive shot, especially since the shooter is only 19 years old. To those who question American exceptionalism, we\u2019d like to point you to this promising young man\u2019s terrific aim.\u201d The NRA also praised the shooter for his choice of weapon, saying that the AR-15 was simply the tool you needed to use if you wanted to get the job done right.\n"

        "Text": "Most innovators are mocked in their own time. Doubters and naysayers always do their best to stifle bold thinking, though in my case, I refused to let the negative voices get to me. I knew I\u2019d live to see the day when my greatest idea would be vindicated, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. They laughed me off as a crazy person when I said we were going to sell the common chicken as food. Well, you know what? I\u2019m the one laughing now.\nBack in 1991, when I took over Perdue Farms, everyone told me it was ludicrous to believe anyone would be interested in eating a simple farm bird. What about the beaks, they said, what about the feathers? They would wince and turn up their noses at the mere word \u201cchicken.\u201d But now you can\u2019t walk into a grocery store anywhere in this country without seeing shelves full of the stuff, and it\u2019s all thanks to yours truly.\nI remember the day I first proposed to my colleagues the idea that chicken could be eaten. You should have seen the looks of revulsion on the Perdue board members\u2019 faces. The moment the picture of the chicken popped up in my PowerPoint presentation, the entire table started to scoff and jeer. \u201cThat\u2019s your big idea?\u201d they said. \u201cThose egg-laying creatures with the talons that scuttle around in their own shit? That\u2019s absolutely disgusting.\u201d They told me I would run the company into the ground if I didn\u2019t give up on this unhinged scheme to put chicken on the shopping list of every American family. And when I persisted, every last one of them resigned.\nNow I have a $6.5 billion empire built on the common chicken, and what do the people who doubted me have? Nothing!\nSure, it took a fair share of trial and error before I figured out how to make the common chicken edible. I tried everything\u2014mashing their entire bodies into a pulp, boiling the waddles for hours on end, blending their necks and livers into a frothy soup\u2014all the while convinced that if I just found the right method of preparation, the critics would be silenced. This went on for years. It wasn\u2019t until I tried cutting off the head and feet and serving the meat instead of the bones that I realized I might have something big on my hands. Boy did I ever!\nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\nDealing with the criticism wasn\u2019t always easy, though. There were times when I had to ask myself, \u201cAre they right about me and my chickens? Maybe they do belong in the coop as far away from people as possible.\u201d But the more others called it madness to hack up chickens and stay awake for days on end cooking them in my basement, the more I knew I had to prove the cynics wrong.\nAnd I showed them, by golly. I showed them all.\nI had to sacrifice everything to achieve my goal of bringing the common chicken to the masses. My friends abandoned me, my father disowned me. My wife left me, too. She\u2019d say, \u201cJim, why can\u2019t you just sell cow like everybody else?\u201d If I came upstairs with a single stray feather on my shirt, she\u2019d gag and heave, and I never got her to eat one measly bite of chicken. Well, now that I\u2019m a chicken billionaire, you can bet she\u2019s eating her words.\nThese days, chicken is served the whole world over. The same people who used to say domesticated fowl should only be fed to criminals and dogs are now going out to their favorite restaurants and ordering\u2014guess what?\u2014chicken. And of course, every company wants a piece of the chicken action, whether it\u2019s KFC, Tyson, or Chick-fil-A, but they\u2019re imitators, imitators all! I was the first, and I laughed all the way to the bank.\nI\u2019ll be laughing even harder once my new line of 100-percent genuine chicken-skin jackets, shoes, and accessories takes off.\n"

Compared to other wealthy nations, the United States sees a far greater percentage of its citizens condemned to the same trash compactor, shredder, of incinerator their family has occupied for generations.\u201d Critics of the study have argued that if Americans are being crushed by 100,000 pounds of pressure inside a solid-steel box, it should only provide them with even more incentive to try to lift themselves up by their bootstraps. \n"

        "Text": "WUHAN, CHINA\u2014Claiming the aquatic mammal had squandered the countless opportunities it had been given, wildlife experts reported Tuesday that the Chinese river dolphin, a species that had an entire 25-million-year period to evolve ways to survive, was pathetically snuffed out by less than a decade of environmental changes.\nAccording to researchers, the dolphin\u2014which hasn\u2019t been spotted in the wild for several years and has been declared functionally extinct\u2014evidently \u201csat around with its thumb up its ass\u201d for epochs before being caught completely off guard by only eight short years of increasing industrial runoff and overfishing within its Yangtze River habitat.\n\u201cChinese river dolphins had literally millions of generations to develop stronger staminas or at least expand their habitat beyond a single river, but they couldn\u2019t get their act together, and now look at them,\u201d said exasperated marine biologist Susan Reese, who explained that if the animal had even a shred of survival instinct, it would have evolved a specialized internal organ to process and filter toxic chemicals instead of wasting all its time developing an elongated beak. \u201cSure, they figured out how to communicate through series of whistles and clicks, but they couldn\u2019t even be bothered to take some time to learn how not to get tangled up in fishing nets and drown all over the goddamn place. Unbelievable.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe a few million years ago they should have paused a moment to consider how to block out underwater noise pollution that affects their echolocation so that they wouldn\u2019t just keel over the second motorboat traffic increased,\u201d Reese continued, referring to the species\u2019 \u201ccompletely embarrassing\u201d tendency to become disoriented in the murky river water and swim into rotating propeller blades. \u201cChrist Almighty, these morons had all the time in the world to figure this stuff out.\u201d\nRolling her eyes as she spoke with reporters, Reese noted that the dolphin had existed 100 times as long as modern humans, somehow surviving violent continental drift and several ice ages, but never once put any thought or effort into developing razor-sharp teeth or claws to hunt prey beyond the fish stocks that have been depleted by high-voltage electrical-charge fishing, basically ensuring the lousy species would die off in just a few measly years.\nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\nAdditionally, while experts admitted that the animal\u2019s streamlined body and ability to swim up to 40 miles per hour were steps in the right direction, they maintained that the species hadn\u2019t taken such adaptations nearly far enough and was \u201cpretty much begging\u201d to be rendered extinct, citing the relative ease with which the dolphin was hunted for its skin and meat.\n\u201cNo camouflage to make them virtually invisible to hunters? No plated armor strong enough to withstand steel spears? No nothing? Let\u2019s be honest here: These dolphins had their chance, and they absolutely blew it,\u201d said zoologist William Nagle, who explained how the cetaceans must have just screwed around for hundreds of millennia. \u201cThey had a 24-million-year head start on us, and yet they didn\u2019t even figure out how to have more than one offspring at a time to increase the chances of more of their kind reaching sexual maturity and propagating the species. Given how fast their population dropped in the last few years, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these idiots died of sheer embarrassment.\u201d\nExperts stated that humans, feeling pity for how badly the species had botched its evolution, took several specimens into captivity several years ago. However, despite having had since the Neogene period to prepare themselves and develop traits necessary to live in a changing ecosystem, the creatures were so functionally inept that most couldn\u2019t even work out a way to survive for more than a few months in the small tanks they were kept in.\n\u201cWe tried to give them a chance, but each one croaked quicker than the last, the stupid losers,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re not even going to try to help yourself, then why the hell should anyone else bother to help you?\u201d\n\u201cFrankly, these dipshits deserved to go extinct,\u201d he added.\nGeneticists said there is enough of the animal\u2019s DNA available that the potential exists to one day clone the river dolphin and restore its numbers, but the species was so worthless they probably won\u2019t bother.\n"

The Onion asked several former employees how they felt about being laid off, and this is what they said.\n\u201cIf Mr. Musk deems it necessary, I can only assume it\u2019s for some very intelligent and well-thought-out reason.\u201d\n\u201cThankfully my Nazi-platforming experience sets me up pretty good for another job at a different social network.\u201d\n\u201cI knew the writing was on the wall the second I did my job competently.\u201d\n\u201cI left after Mr. Musk asked where I saw myself five kids from now.\u201d\n\u201cI filmed a video r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of me dancing to Lizzo\u2019s \u201cAbout Damn Time,\u201d so I\u2019m sure TikTok will get back to me about a job soon.\u201d\n\u201cI refused to open the email I got, so for all I know, I still work there.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be fired for something besides sexual harassment for once.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to think how difficult it will be to continue the important work of destroying democracy from someplace like LinkedIn or Shopify.\u201d\n\u201cI can always get another job working for one of the other wealthy people who hates and disrespects me.\u201d\n\u201cI was pretty worried. Thankfully I got a job offer from Twitter the following day.\u201d\n\u201cEver since I was let go, a self-driving Tesla started circling my block and then speeding up whenever I go outside. I\u2019m afraid to leave the house.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just ecstatic Elon even acknowledged me when he asked, \u2018Who let that black guy into the meeting?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI resigned as CEO last year, but he sent me a dismissal email just to be a dick.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I got fired a few weeks ago for embezzlement, but this\u2019ll play way better in job interviews.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been offered my job back if I become something called a \u2018Musk bride.\u2019 I have no other prospects, so I\u2019m considering it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really awkward when it\u2019s Elon\u2019s turn to watch our kids next weekend.\u201d\n\u201cWait what?! I didn\u2019t get an email!\u201d\n\u201cIt really sucks getting fired by an email that has the word \u2018epicsauce\u2019 in it.\u201d\n\u201cElon will come crawling back when he realizes I\u2019m the only one who knows how to format screenshots so they don\u2019t zoom in too much.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, it was kind of a conflict of interest for me to be working there in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI will be leaving for Mastodon as soon as I figure out what that is.\u201d\n\u201cI was really hoping I could stay on to see the company become more open-minded about sexual harassment.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be better off at Facebook, with its more predictable shittiness.\u201d\n\u201cAt least my family won\u2019t be ashamed of me anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIt was pretty disappointing until I was asked to come back, then let go again, and then asked to come back. I\u2019m feeling pretty good about\u2014oh no, just got a notification. Shit.\u201d\n"

One thing specifically I\u2019d like to get read on is how many limbs, eyes, and heads we think an animal can have before it\u2019s considered a horrific monstrosity.

        "Title": "The Misogyny Interwoven Into Our Patriarchal Society Harms Men, Too\n",
        "Text": "On this International Women\u2019s Day, The Onion devotes its sterling reportage to championing women\u2014a small but influential sliver of the nation\u2019s population\u2014in an endeavor to prevent them from vanishing from the public consciousness entirely.\ufeff\nWhen we talk about the damaging consequences of sexism, we usually focus on the effects it has on women and girls, but as someone with a certain level of real-world expertise in this particular field, I can tell you that the misogyny interwoven into our patriarchal society harms men, too.\nWhile the patriarchy may reinforce structural violence against women by projecting discriminatory gender roles, I\u2019m also suffering in a Romanian prison cell for human trafficking because the general structure of the world I was brought up in allowed and encouraged me to dehumanize women and gave me the entitlement to manipulate and use them for my own gain.\nI\u2019m a victim, too.\nIt took my own incarceration to make me realize that the patriarchy\u2019s demand for men to embody the \u201cmasculine\u201d traits of aggression, physical strength, subjugation of women, total self-sufficiency, and a win-at-any-cost mentality has negative effects on men as well. Because, when you sit there and think about it, what drives a man to tweet at a young climate change activist about the 33 supercars he owns, which then indirectly leads to his arrest? Is it our nature? Our biology? Our own twisted thoughts, marketed to men who want to hear their desperation echoed on a larger, for-profit platform?\nNo, I blame the patriarchy.\nThese sexist societal norms pressure men to conform into a narrow definition of masculinity that forces them to cut off their emotions, leaving them without the necessary inner resources to form meaningful relationships or process their own feelings. This lack of emotional intelligence inevitably leads them down the path of becoming a former professional kickboxer-turned-rich-social-media-influencer who monetizes misogyny, only to be unjustly imprisoned by the same society that created him.\nUnfortunately, the patriarchy has impressionable young men believing that a guy who hides his insecurities with surface-level wealth and abuses vulnerable women to make himself feel more powerful has the answer to how to be the \u201cideal man.\u201d\nI witnessed the damage the patriarchy was causing firsthand as hundreds of lonely, confused men threw their money away at a fraudulent online pyramid scheme called Hustlers University because it promised get-rich-quick schemes and tips on how to get women to sleep with them to fulfill their desperate pursuit of society\u2019s superficial standard of manhood.\nSadly, it was the patriarchy that made them so easy to exploit.\nThe fact is, if we don\u2019t change our most basic societal assumptions, we will continue to unfairly punish men like myself for the things society taught them to do. As the trailblazing feminist scholar and activist bell hooks once said, \u2018Failure to examine the victimization of men keeps us from understanding maleness, from uncovering the space of connection that might lead more men to seek feminist transformation.\u2019 So we must treat the cause, not the symptom.\nAnd that\u2019s why, upon my release, I will see it as my personal mission to help men rid the shackles of the patriarchy, and I call upon my fellow men\u2019s activists to join me by enrolling in my new online academy that will instruct them on how to once and for all dismantle the bygone ideals of masculinity for just $49.99 a month.\n"

Still, the relationship between humans and maize began to warm up when early humans fed meat to corn to gain its trust, eventually turning it into a companion grain.\u201d Royer added that not all of the early humans\u2019 attempts at selective breeding were as successful, noting that their effort to domesticate wolves resulted in the canines becoming a hirsute fruit.\n"

For example, it can simply make up a demented  answer to a question on any topic on the spot. Legacy media operations  really can\u2019t keep up with that pace.\u201d Adams rushed to add that the study  didn\u2019t apply to Rupert Murdoch, who could see his own febrile  imagination on display daily on Fox News.\n"

        "Text": "WASHINGTON\u2014A new report released Tuesday by the Department of Justice found that the minority of murders in the U.S. were committed by someone the victim didn\u2019t know, but could have if they had gone out and socialized more. \u201cOne out of 10 murder victims were most likely killed by a complete stranger because the victim stayed at home most nights, never really making the effort to go to a party or a bar with friends to mingle and meet new people,\u201d said Dennis Rand, coauthor of the report, explaining the National Crime Survey data showed that if the victims had just overcome their own inhibitions that kept them trapped in their own little worlds, and instead, put themselves out there every once in a while, they could have been murdered by a friend, or at the very least, an acquaintance they saw at the occasional barbecue or summer soccer league game\u2014if they had ever joined in the first place, which they didn\u2019t. \u201cSadly, 10% of those murdered were killed by someone who didn\u2019t know their name, and, frankly, was only aware of their existence long enough to kill them. The minority of murder victims died sad and alone at the hands of an unknown assailant, when all it would have taken for them to be killed by someone they knew and possibly cared for was the audacity to participate in the world as a human being, which, for all they know, could have led to not only knowing their killer, but a meaningful relationship that helped them grow as people\u2014hell, who knows? It may have even led to something greater, possibly even knowing their killer on the most intimate level as \u2018husband\u2019 or \u2018wife.\u2019\u201d Rand added that it was all the missed opportunities to open themselves up and know the person, who would kill them, that really made him feel sad for the victims. \n"

Or maybe she\u2019s a friend and he wanted to show her how nice our sheets feel on bare skin. Lots of explanations that make more sense than what I was thinking.\u201d Waldman added that her only regret was that the nude stranger had gathered her clothes and scrambled out the window before they could clear all of this up together.\n"

        "Title": "Joe Biden Deserves 4 More Years Of Making My Centrist Baby Boomer Pussy Sopping Wet\n",
        "Text": "Today, President Joe Biden has the world against him. Despite his countless legislative wins, many so-called Democrats would rather see one of the best public servants in modern American history pack his bags, leave the White House, and retire. Well, to them I say: You could not be more wrong. Joe Biden deserves four more years of making my centrist baby boomer pussy sopping wet. \nSorry, Bernie Bros. I\u2019m a 67-year-old lifelong Democrat; my vagina is absolutely saturated with thick, hot clam sauce from the mere thought of a second Joe Biden term; and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do about it.\nThat\u2019s right. Even just mentioning Joe Biden and his moderate agenda has awakened within the very depths of my loins a hot, bubbling spring of freshly squeezed, unpasteurized pussy nectar. From the day he was elected, Joe Biden got to work fixing America, and just thinking about it, as I type, is conjuring forth a geyser of juices so powerful it\u2019s all but melted a gaping hole in my high-waisted granny panties.\nRight now I\u2019m sitting in a pool of my own boiling hot crotch broth reflecting on all the civility, respect, and compromise Joe Biden has brought back to Washington. The fact that he\u2019s willing to talk to Republicans, be their friends, and actually hear them out is enough to flood my basement with so much lady sludge that, let\u2019s just say, I\u2019ll definitely be ripping out the carpet.\nIn 2024, we will need Joe Biden to \u201cBuild Back Better,\u201d because this torrent of poon juice exploding from my aging snapper is going to cause serious damage to our great country.\nStart stacking sandbags, people. There\u2019s a deadly blue wave forming right between this loyal, Occupy Democrats\u2013loving, ActBlue donor\u2019s legs. When Joe Biden reached across the aisle and passed the $3 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I should have called in the Coast Guard, because this upper-class, Ivy League\u2013educated liberal\u2019s clam dam is about to burst.\nUnfortunately, many Americans are going to drown.\nAnd the best part is, Joe Biden is just getting started. If he runs again in 2024 and starts wearing those aviators, licking ice cream cones, and saying things like \u201cNo malarkey,\u201d I might actually pass out. I\u2019m serious. I slid off my chair and am currently lying face down in several inches of my own absolutely putrid female fluids. Lord, help me.\nAt the end of the day, America needs someone like Joe Biden to heal our divided nation and restore it to a position of respect on the world stage. In 2024, I hope I can march my wet ham to the voting booth, slosh my boomer ass down, and let this baby rip.\nSo please join me, America. Let\u2019s band together, get Biden into the White House, and drown together in my pussy juices for four more years.\nOh God. Yeah. That\u2019s a gusher.\n"

Well, because  you dumbasses will lap up whatever shit we throw your way. How\u2019s that? In fact, we might not even  put the characters in their superhero costumes. People already know what those  look like. They can imagine all the colorful action for themselves. What the hell else do you want? Oh  yeah, and Andy Serkis will probably be in most of these, too, but we  aren\u2019t going to do anything special with him. It\u2019ll just be Andy Serkis  wandering around in a skin-tight green suit.\u201d Feige added that  if the current experiment was successful, Marvel might move toward a future  in which it did away with visuals and audio entirely, making movies that simply entailed sitting in a dark theater for two hours and 15 minutes.\n"

        "Text": "Onion Sports shares its expert analysis on the teams that will come away with victory in the NFL\u2019s Conference Championships.\n49ers: An upset win shocks the Philadelphia crowd who are still sober enough to follow what\u2019s happening in the game.\nKyle Shanahan: Ready to show that his performance as offensive coordinator in the Falcons\u2019 massive Super Bowl LI choke was no fluke.\nNick Sirianni: Has silenced his doubters by managing to string together a credible coaching career despite going undrafted.\nBrock Purdy: The rookie has 12 touchdowns to three interceptions despite needing to use both of his tiny hands to throw the football.\nJalen Hurts: Philly\u2019s QB is a lock for MVP, so at this point he probably doesn\u2019t care whether the Eagles win this game or not.\nDeebo Samuel: The electric wideout led the league in bending the time-space continuum with the most catches after the catch.\nA.J. Brown: The Eagles receiver has it all: hands, legs, feet, arms, ears, a neck, you name it.\nNick Bosa: The defensive end fully utilizes his strength and power to burst through quarterbacks.\nJavon Hargrave: The Eagles\u2019 defensive tackle contributed to his team\u2019s record 70 sacks this season, many of which were made during football games.\nEagles fans may start celebrating a little too early by burning down Lincoln Financial Field several hours before kickoff.\nChiefs: Expect Patrick Mahomes to hobble for over 50 yards and limp for two touchdowns.\nZac Taylor: Despite some recent success, it\u2019s hard to fathom how Taylor still has a job after failing to win a Super Bowl with Andy Dalton.\nAndy Reid: There\u2019s no coach more primed and focused on triumphantly returning to the Super Bowl buffet.\nJoe Burrow: Cincy\u2019s phenom QB has proven he has what it takes to lose the Super Bowl.\nPatrick Mahomes: Despite suffering a high ankle sprain during last weekend\u2019s matchup, Mahomes is confident he still has the mobility to reach the medical tent.\nJa\u2019Marr Chase: The explosive wideout has great burst, game-breaking speed, and excellent hands, but insists on constantly wearing tacky animal prints.\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling: He will need to rely on his large frame and top-end speed if he wants any chance at getting one of Travis Kelce\u2019s targets.\n Trey Hendrickson: The defensive end isn\u2019t letting a broken wrist keep him from playing in the AFC Championship Game, which is frankly scary and honestly kind of fucked up.\nCarlos Dunlap: The pass rusher\u2019s mother asked us to mention that he\u2019s earned a Masters of Business Administration and that he should really think about working for his uncle at the fireplace store.\nThe AFC Championship could spell trouble for the Chiefs, and head coach Andy Reid may struggle focusing on the task at hand as it is scheduled right during dinner time.\n"

And Lennie\u2019s childlike innocence was beautifully captured through the simple, ranch-hand slang words like \u2018mentally handicapped\u2019 and \u2018retarded.\u2019\u201d\nAdded Weaver: \u201cI never wanted the synopsis to end.\u201d\nWeaver, who formed an \u201cinstant connection\u201d with Lennie\u2019s character-description paragraph, said she began to suspect the novel might end tragically after reading the fourth sentence which suggested the gentle giant\u2019s strength and fascination with soft things would \u201clead to his untimely demise.\u201d\n\u201cI was amazed at how attached to him I had become just from the critical commentary,\u201d said Weaver, still clutching the yellow-and-black-striped study guide. \u201cWhen I got to the last sentence\u2014\u2019George shoots Lennie in the head,\u2019\u2014it seemed so abrupt.

I\u2019m also going to try to find that book about rabbits that George was always reading to Lennie, so that I can really understand that important allusion.\u201d\nWithin an hour of completing the cliffs notes, Weaver was already telling friends and classmates that Steinbeck was her favorite author, as well as reciting select quotations from the \u201cImportant Quotations\u201d section for their benefit.\n\u201cWhen I read those quotes, found out which characters they were attributed to, and inferred their context from the chapter outlines to piece together their significance, I was just blown away,\u201d said a teary-eyed Weaver. \u201cAnd the way Steinbeck wove the theme of hands all the way through the section entitled \u2018Hands\u2019\u2014he definitely deserved to win that Nobel Prize.\u201d\nWeaver\u2019s roommate, Giulia Crenshaw, has already borrowed the dog-eared, highlighted summary of the classic Depression-era saga, and is expecting to enjoy reading what Weaver described as \u201ca really sad story about two brothers who love to farm.\u201d\n\u201cI loved this book so much, I\u2019m going to read all of Steinbeck\u2019s Cliffs Notes,\u201d said Weaver. \u201cBut first I\u2019m going to go to the library to check out the original version Of Mice And Men starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.\u201d\n"

Give it.

There, McCabe expects to bump into at least five insufferable assholes in the first three minutes.\nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\n\u201cGuaranteed Ricky Cook will be there,\u201d said McCabe, adding that there isn\u2019t much else to do in his hometown. \u201cAnd probably Vanessa Torres, and that dickhead Michael Schmidt. Yeah, Schimdt will definitely be there. Probably be hammered, too.\u201d\nAt Marleybone, McCabe will be required to partake in a number of unpleasant activities, including making small talk with several assholes who used to openly mock him during high school, and reminiscing about the \u201cgood old days\u201d of which he was never a part. While the consumption of alcohol will initially make the evening more tolerable, McCabe is ultimately expected to leave the bar after realizing he has just as little in common with all these assholes as he did when he was 15.\n\u201cKatie Reynolds will probably come up and give me a big hug like we\u2019re the best of friends, even though she never once talked to me during school, and pretty much acted like I was invisible the whole time,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cBoy, I can\u2019t wait to hug that bitch again.\u201d\nAfter leaving Marleybone, the 26-year-old predicts he will patronize Bud Murphy\u2019s Tavern, a favorite haunt for locals, where an even greater number of assholes are expected to congregate in even higher densities.\nAssholes such as Craig Horble, Kyle Davis, Vinny Iagosa, Brittany Pipitone, Justin Smigowski, Nick Casey, and Nick\u2019s asshole brother, Dennis.\nAccording to McCabe, all the assholes in attendance will look the same except for being 10 to 20 pounds heavier, and possibly sporting a new beard or goatee. However, that same old shit-eating grin will still be on all their faces, McCabe reported.\nIf previous years are any indication, assholes who live in the area will not be the only ones out the night before Thanksgiving. Like McCabe, who since graduation has moved to New York, many Marshall High School alumni are expected to return from their new homes all across the country.\n\u201cI bet Bill Harding is going to show up and talk about his big lawyer job in San Francisco,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI can see it now: \u2018You know, hours are a real bitch. Money\u2019s good, though.\u2019 I\u2019ve known that guy since fifth grade. He\u2019s always been an asshole.\u201d\nEarly reports indicate that the mingling of assholes will likely trigger a fight between the hours of 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., with a scuffle expected moments after two giant assholes argue over who rushed for more touchdowns during senior year. McCabe said that he usually tries to avoid any involvement in these fights, but nonetheless anticipates an elbow to his forehead or at the very least a spilled drink on his pants.\n\u201c[Wayne] Maldonado just loves to run his mouth, especially when it comes to talking shit about people\u2019s girlfriends,\u201d McCabe continued. \u201cHe used to be kind of scary when we were all in school, but the guy is almost 30 now. I feel kind of bad for him.\u201d\nThough he remains anxious about the inevitable fracas, McCabe explained that those experiences are usually counterbalanced with more pleasurable events, such as finding out which assholes now have kids.\n\u201cI heard Marissa Feely got knocked up this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is that? The third time?\u201d\nThe 26-year-old is not the only one dreading the upcoming week. Several Marshall High School alumni have expressed similar misgivings about running into former classmates on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe McCabe is coming back,\u201d said local resident Ricky Cook. \u201cThat guy\u2019s such a fuckin\u2019 asshole.\u201d\n"

However, our data suggests putting a kink into a man\u2019s genitals can often result in the penis springing leaks. Worse still are cases in which the sperm builds up at the knot and eventually shoots back up into the man. What we\u2019re saying is there are better options out there.\u201d The FDA added that users of this form of birth control could supplement it by inflating a condom, tying it into a balloon animal, and then placing it on the knotted-up penis.\n"

As its liquidity dried up, his personal net worth of $16 billion was reduced to zero. Friends described Bankman-Fried as despondent and unsure what to do until he reportedly discovered a crypto he hadn\u2019t known he had under the couch in his apartment.\n\u201cAs long as I have you, I\u2019ll always have hope!\u201d the 30-year-old investor was heard to say to his last remaining cryptocurrency, holding it up in delight and wonder. Realizing he still had a crypto left to his name reversed his sullen mood in an instant, sources confirmed, and Bankman-Fried declared that this one cryptocurrency was all he needed to rebuild his reputation and fortune.\nThe rejuvenated entrepreneur then reportedly left his apartment and took a stroll down the streets of Nassau with what onlookers described as a spring in his step. He was said to periodically remove his last cryptocurrency from his pocket to stare at it, a look of pure joy on his face. A friend confirmed that the man known as SBF said over text that not even the looming threat of a criminal investigation into his  activities with his asset management firm Alameda Group could bring him down with his last cryptocurrency by his side.\n\u201cI\u2019m on top of the world!\u201d he was heard to exclaim to random passersby, who all smiled his way.

Several bystanders confirmed that he tripped over the hydrant, sprawling to the sidewalk, and his last crypto skidded out of his grasp.\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Bankman-Fried reportedly shouted until his voice was hoarse.\nOnlookers said that the cryptocurrency then began to slide down the street as Bankman-Fried stumbled after it. Shouting, \u201cGet back here!\u201d, he repeatedly lunged at the rolling crypto, missing it every time, until he fell flat on his stomach in the street several feet from a sewer.\nSources confirmed that the disgraced investor was then forced to watch in what felt like slow motion as his last crypto in the world teetered on the edge of the sewer grate. For a moment, it reportedly looked like it would just fall harmlessly onto the frame, but it took one last spin and plunged into the sewer.\n\u201cI\u2019m ruined!\u201d Bankman-Fried was heard to shout, tears in his eyes, as he crawled over to the grate. He then spent several minutes staring at the cryptocurrency, which had reportedly given him the hope and confidence that he could regain the life he had lost, as it sat in the sewer on a pile of leaves and garbage, just out of reach.\nIn between heaving sobs, Bankman-Fried reportedly begged a pedestrian for a stick of gum. After chewing the gum for a few moments, he grabbed a stick lying nearby and placed the lubricated gum on the end of the stick. Multiple onlookers confirmed that he spent several panicked minutes inserting the stick into the sewer grate in an attempt to get the cryptocurrency to stick to the gum. \nSources observing the weeping former CEO reported that this didn\u2019t work at all.\nAt press time, Bankman-Fried had stuck his arm through the grate and was screaming for help after realizing it was stuck.\n"

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been doing crunches on the Senate floor, and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) is begging us all to follow her weight-loss journey on the app. TikTok is, without a doubt, a growing threat to a functional American society.\u201d At press time, Congress had passed a massive bipartisan funding bill to purchase diet pills they saw on TikTok. \n"

Now, through a bipartisan effort to completely ignore calls to replace the Civil War-era braking systems on most of our great nation\u2019s trains, we transformed this area seemingly overnight.

Financially, I save a ton of money because I\u2019m not kicking down doors, punching holes through walls, or setting the couch on fire. And mentally, I almost always sleep through the night now because no one is crying or calling the police. Come Feb. 1, I\u2019ll almost be sad to start drinking again.\u201d At press time, Thatcher could not be reached for comment, as he had declared that day a cheat day and gone on a massive all-night family-beating bender.\n"

Why not cast Jonathan Majors? LaKeith Stanfield? Even Michael Ealy could\u2019ve knocked it out of the park, but once again, Hollywood has chosen to engage in historical erasure to fit a white-centric ideal, in this case an Elvis who would be palatable to a larger demographic.

It\u2019s important to make sure he\u2019s spending enough unmonitored time online. There are plenty of resources available through Reddit and 4Chan that can help him development the tools he needs to express hate for women and minorities. But to be honest, there\u2019s a lot to be said for just showing him a couple neo-Nazi videos on YouTube and letting the algorithm take it from there.\u201d According to reports, the pediatrician went on to recommend a hate speech therapist to help the child work on his hard r\u2019s. \n"

EDGE: Eagles.\nChiefs DT Chris Jones is one of the most talented defensive players in the NFL, and if you\u2019re the rest of the Chiefs defensive line, all you can do is stand back and watch. EDGE: Eagles.\nWith a defense led by outside linebacker Haason Reddick, expect Philly to put pressure on Mahomes the instant he leaves his hotel room. EDGE: Eagles.\nJustin Reid: The Chiefs safety displays great thoughtfulness and empathy while breaking up passes. EDGE: Chiefs.\nL\u2019Jarius Sneed: The Chiefs were one of the first teams in the NFL to risk a fourth-round draft pick on a relatively unknown cornerback from Hogwarts.

When Todd was young, he learned that most problems could be solved with a swat from a rolled-up newspaper. In fact, that\u2019s how the dog who owned Todd potty-trained him. Because he grew up thinking all this was acceptable, Todd does the very same things today.\u201d The psychologist added that much of Todd\u2019s treatment of Duke could be explained by the fact his owner had regularly forced him to compete in underground child-fighting rings. \n"

Though the smell of burning flesh filled the air the moment his fingertips touched the sauce, and the tears streaming from his eyes evaporated with a sizzle upon the heat of his cheeks, Perkins is said to have declined multiple offers of water. Witnesses confirmed he did this by shaking his head, his ability to speak having been compromised once the wing dressing had dissolved enough muscle tissue to leave his jawbone dangling from a single, thinning tendon. Shortly before suffering multiple organ failure, Perkins reportedly wrote on a napkin that if the restaurant didn\u2019t have anything hotter, he would simply have to pour more sauce onto his next bite to compensate for \u201cthis weak shit\u201d he had been served. \n"

        "Text": "The task of reporting is not a simple one. Each and every day, reporters and editors at publications like The Onion make difficult decisions about which issues should receive attention, knowing that our coverage will influence not only how people think, but also how they act. This responsibility is at the core of an ongoing debate over whether news coverage of transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming people is unduly biased. As the world\u2019s leading news publication with a daily readership of 4.3 trillion, The Onion is compelled to weigh in.\nWe firmly believe that it is journalism\u2019s sacred duty to endanger the lives of as many trans people as possible.\n\u201cQuentin\u201d is a 14-year-old assigned female at birth who now identifies as male against the wishes of his parents. His transition was supported by one of his unmarried teachers, who is not a virgin. He stole his parents\u2019 car and drove to the hospital, where a doctor immediately began performing top surgery on him. Afterward, driving home drunk from the hospital, Quentin became suicidally depressed, and he wonders now, homeless and ridden with gonorrhea, if transitioning was a mistake. \nWe just made Quentin up, and that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t mean stories like his aren\u2019t potentially happening everywhere, constantly. Good journalism is about finding those stories, even when they don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s about asking the tough questions and ignoring the answers you don\u2019t like, then offering misleading evidence in service of preordained editorial conclusions. In our case, endangering trans people is the lodestar that shapes our coverage. Frankly, if our work isn\u2019t putting trans people further at risk of trauma and violence, we consider it a failure.\nWe stand behind our recent obsessed-seeming torrent of articles and essays on trans people, which we believe faithfully depicts their lived experiences as weird and gross. We remain dedicated to finding the angles that best frame the basic rights of the gender-nonconforming as up for debate, and we will use these same angles over and over again in hopes that this repetition makes them suffer. As journalists, it is our obligation to entertain any and all pseudoscience that gives bigotry an intellectual veneer. We must be diligent in laundering our vitriol through the posture of journalistic inquiry, and we must be allowed to fixate on the genitals. \nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\nIt is against free speech to stop us from fixating on the genitals. \nMuch of the recent debate concerns medical procedures, particularly in children, and whether things like hormone replacement therapy or gender-affirming surgeries are safe and appropriate. Indeed, there are critical questions to be asked about the social complexities of gender, as well as medical ethics in a profit-driven healthcare system. We are simply not interested in any of that. Instead, we will use flawed data and spurious logic to repeatedly write the same hand-wringing arguments asking whether there are suddenly too many trans people around. Journalistic integrity demands nothing less. \nNaturally, courageous reporting like ours has its detractors. Our critics accuse us of transphobia and are trying to murder us online, with their online mobs. They want to destroy our right to free speech and have us arrested by all the police. What gives? Why would you arrest us, when it\u2019s those deviant trans people you ought to be arresting instead? Do you know what the science says about trans people getting arrested, huh? What if we could find data saying trans people should be more likely to get arrested? What will our detractors say then? They\u2019ll be silent, as well they should be, and free speech will survive one more day. \nFor more evidence of our time-honored journalistic commitment to endangering lives, please see our previous coverage of gay people, immigrants, Black people, and women.\nInstitutions with massive platforms like ours must be open to different ways of endangering the trans community. That might mean using the framework of medical care as a bogeyman to imply that trans people are engaged in something sinister. That might mean turning isolated instances of detransitioning into sweeping generalizations about children being groomed. That might mean identifying the worst prejudices that transgender people face\u2014and encouraging our readers to adopt them.\nDid you forget yet about how we wrote that there might be data showing that trans people should be more likely to get arrested? What if that were true? Or what if non-binary people are ten times more likely to traffic infants? What if puberty blockers are a kind of sex crime? What if doctors are climbing through windows to suture penises to sleeping cheerleaders? The next time you see a trans person, you ought to ask yourself these questions.\nAll great journalists, and even those lesser journalists who don\u2019t work for The Onion, eventually ponder why we do what we do. Is the point of reporting to illuminate the world around us, so that we may make meaning of it? Or is it to cause people in minority groups to question their humanity and persuade others to demonize them? We know where we stand, proudly dreaming of genitals. \nResearch shows that trans people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to be the victim of a violent crime. We salute our colleagues across the media who are working tirelessly to make that number even higher. \n\u2014The Onion Editorial Board\n"

But once that painstaking, piecemeal approach is finished, we should have no problem stitching all the parts together and giving the world its first woolly mammoth in 10,000 years.\u201d  At press time, reporters fled the room when the disembodied trunk, apparently both sentient and angry, began strangling to death each of the geneticists responsible for bringing it to life as a horrific freak.\n"

Another option is to leave the show before it ends, but please be aware we charge a $200 ticket-change fee for concertgoers who decide they want to go home early because the band sucks.\u201d At press time, several hundred Taylor Swift fans had reportedly been trampled to death in Arizona after Ticketmaster\u2019s demand-based pricing system pushed the cost of exiting State Farm Stadium to more than $10,000.\n"

Our study presents a cautionary tale about putting plastic lines in pools, which all too often result in a lap swimmer accidentally veering into them and getting snarled in the plastic, or a wayward child asphyxiating themselves after the lane divider becomes wrapped around their neck. Unfortunately, if this trend continues, we\u2019ve projected that by 2060, the recreational swimmer population could dwindle down to almost nothing.\u201d The study also found that around 500 people die every year after choking on pairs of swim goggles that have been mistakenly left in pools.\n"

This, combined with a genetic predisposition toward pillaging the earth with no regard for tomorrow, would have derailed the ecosystems that sustained them just as effectively as an extraterrestrial object colliding with the planet and setting in on fire.\u201d Fortunately, Schueneman added, an asteroid stopping a shortsighted and narcissistic animal from destroying the entire planet was a rare event and one unlikely to recur anytime soon.\n"

Huh? Or was it God? Look, buddy, we can do this the easy way or we can do it by plasma-boarding. Your choice.\u201d After refusing to say life was anything more than the byproduct of a chemical accident that produced self-replicating proteins, the amoeba was reportedly locked alone in a darkened petri dish with the same Marilyn Manson song playing on repeat. \n"

When the closing credits began to roll, the man grabbed his backpack and was the first one to leave the theater.\n\u201cIt was okay,\u201d the man, who has reportedly reached an old enough age where it\u2019s not inconceivable that he\u2019ll be alone all his life, said. \u201cNothing special.\u201d\nAt press time, the heartbreaking loser had entered his apartment, sat on his couch, sighed, and turned on his television.\n"

        "Text": "Throughout recorded history, humans have been clever and resourceful as they sought out ways to avoid getting saddled down with an unwanted kid. The Onion looks back on the most ingenious forms of birth control used in ancient times.\nThis ancient Egyptian birth control method involved wrapping the penis tightly in linen and treating it with embalming fluids.\nIf nothing else worked out, there was always the option of throwing the dice, getting pregnant, and immediately dying during childbirth.\nUsed as early as the fifth century B.C. by Romans, the vaginal cork saw some success in preventing an infant from escaping through the birth canal.\nJust a small amount of cinnamon\u2014one of the oldest spices in the world\u2014mixed into any dish has always been enough to terminate a pregnancy. Oh, sorry, you didn\u2019t know?\nOf course, as belief in Poseidon dwindled, so did the use of this fairly successful method.\nOne of the methods most widely used by early humans.\nAs far back as ancient Rome, people would often prevent pregnancy by throwing themselves into the mouths of hungry lions immediately after sex.\nEven back in ancient times, guilt was a powerful tool.\nOne hundred percent effective against pregnancy when received before sex or after the baby has already been born, especially if administered by a complete stranger.\nOne million years ago, early humans learned to wield fire for the primary purpose of frightening advancing sperm away from a woman\u2019s vagina.\nThe intrauterine ornithopter was a device designed by Leonardo da Vinci to fly up into the uterus and through the fallopian tubes to stop an egg from releasing.\nThis clever trick used mostly by women of the peasant class  involved not eating enough nutrients to ovulate properly.\nBefore the more prudish sexual attitudes of modern times developed, ancient humans would seek out those who were incapable of producing children as a result of being dead or children themselves.\nThis highly effective birth control method prevented pregnancy 100% of the time.\nIn ancient times, many pregnancies were avoided simply by pushing a person to the bottom of a 30-foot-deep well.\nAncient people knew that if the penis had been destroyed by a rock, it could not get anyone or anything pregnant.\nOriginally invented by Greek philosopher Pythagoras, this brilliant birth control method was practiced by geniuses from Isaac Newton to Bertrand Russell.\nEven when emergency contraception just consisted of swallowing a poisonous herb, ancient men still wanted to go halfsies.\nIt worked perfectly every time, and without any need for medicines or external devices. Too bad the Mayans all got slaughtered and the only 100% successful form of natural birth control was lost to history.\n\u2019Sblood, the ladye was more pox-ridden than a fowle warthog\u2019s arse. Get thee from here, broke-ass wench.\nDispleasing the pharaoh and being summarily executed was a surefire way of avoiding an unwanted birth.\nWhen the ancient Romans ran out of beetroot or thistles to rub on their dicks, they would usually just run to the closest bodega and grab one of these\u2014just to make sure.\nThis surefire recipe for an ancient elixir\u2014applied under a solstice-night moon\u2014had a near-perfect success rate as long as the partner broke down in tears and apologized profusely for not lasting longer.\nArby\u2019s signature sauce was used in Babylon as spermicide.\nWhat To Say When Someone Asks Why You Don\u2019t Have Kids\nShocking Things No One Told You About Childbirth\nCompletely Legal Reasons Pharmacists Can Use To Refuse Birth Control\nBack To Homepage\n"

Adam Schiff (D-CA) reportedly sought Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s campaign endorsement Tuesday by playing into the delusion that he\u2019s her high school sweetheart who actually died in World War II. Multiple Capitol sources have reported seeing the California congressman in recent days sporting a wig and a World War II uniform while escorting the 89-year-old to a vintage jalopy, telling her that he\u2019s back from the war, and taking her to the soda fountain. While all of the California Senate candidates have sought Feinstein\u2019s endorsement, Schiff reportedly decided to capitalize on her declining mental faculties by adopting the identity of her high school sweetheart, Roger Larsen, whom she has apparently forgotten was killed in action during the 1945 Battle of Luzon. Sources confirmed that Schiff\u2019s efforts began in the hours after Feinstein announced she would retire when her Senate term ended, and 62-year-old Schiff entered her office in the guise of her 18-year-old high school sweetheart and told her that her parents had given him permission to take their lovely daughter Dianne Goldman for a drive. This effort seems to have been effective as an increasingly delusional Feinstein has been seen around Washington wearing a poodle skirt Schiff gave her along with his pin to symbolize his commitment, gazing dreamily at Schiff and telling him that, although she thinks he\u2019s swell, she\u2019s a good girl and wants to wait until marriage for her first time. Sources confirmed that Schiff has privately expressed his confidence that the Roger Larsen character can convince Feinstein to support his candidacy, as he has repeatedly told Feinstein that a brave soldier named Adam Schiff is the only reason he made it out of the Pacific Theater and back into Feinstein\u2019s sweet, young embrace. At press time, however, Schiff\u2019s efforts to exploit Feinstein\u2019s disoriented fantasies were dealt a significant complication after fellow Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) donned a string of pearls and a bouffant hairstyle to play into the delusion that she\u2019s Feinstein\u2019s mother, Betty Goldman, who died in 1983.\n"

The Onion asked politicians why they oppose caps on government leadership, and this is what they said.\n\u201cLegislators are proud people who have never known any other work and have been legislating for generations. What else are they supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cI get paid $174k, and I don\u2019t have to do shit. I\u2019m not giving up this gig anytime soon, and all you fuckers just have to deal.\u201d\n\u201cEight years simply isn\u2019t enough time to do all the damage I aspire to do.\u201d\n\u201cI actually see no problem with a two-lifetime limit.\u201d\u200b\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sharp learning curve, and you don\u2019t want a bunch of amateurs in here. For example, did you know that \u2018yea\u2019 means \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018nay\u2019 means \u2018no\u2019? It\u2019s not as simple as it looks.\u201d\n\u201cI will not respect anyone\u2019s limits.\u201d\n\u201cAn extremely elderly Senate makes me look even younger and hotter.\u201d\n\u201cMarco Rubio drives 90 through school zones. He will bring way more than 15 items to the express checkout line. Marco doesn\u2019t care about your safe word\u2014he\u2019s gonna keep choking you until you black out. Limits are for losers, and Marco Rubio is a winner, baby.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve cut all the unemployment benefits I would have received if I lost this job.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unpopular position, which is why I take it.\u201d\n\u201cMy family sucks, and I don\u2019t want to be forced to go home to them.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me out of the workforce with nothing but time on my hands.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t be out of a job. Who else is gonna hire ol\u2019 Dicky Durbin? The post office? The shop down the street? I ain\u2019t cut out for it! Please, this is all I\u2019ve got. Don\u2019t just take it away!\u201d\n\u201cI can no longer remember what I did before I became a senator, and I\u2019m too embarrassed to ask at this point.\u201d\n\u201cYou need a few terms to really get the hang of insider trading.\u201d\n\u201cIf voters want to make the same terrible mistake over and over again, who are we to stop them?\u201d\n\u201cI have absolutely zero skills that would translate to any other job. If I worked in a factory, I would be swallowed by a wheat thresher almost immediately.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to totally marginalize the voice of special interest groups.\u201d\n\u201cThe people of Fair Haven elected a goat mayor as a joke, but once I tasted power, I knew I would never give it up. My totalitarian impulses know no bounds, and my reign will end over my cold dead hooves.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not too jazzed about any law that restricts things based on years.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather die in the Senate than a nursing home.\u201d\n"

In addition, the positive relationship between browsing vegetarian cookbooks and restaurants online and overall longevity seems especially promising.\u201d The researchers went on to state, however, that the benefits of considering a vegetarian diet still paled in comparison to those enjoyed by individuals who inform friends they were now officially meat-free and haven\u2019t had a burger in more than a week.\n"

Sources confirmed that Teresa Baker showed an astounding capacity for diverting the mounting psychological torment of her inability to realistically better her life in any material way due to forces well beyond her control into a six-minute tirade at a young cashier for the store being out of the kind of milk she wanted for the second consecutive week. While the mother of two was reportedly aware on some level that she was taking out her frustrations with an increasingly opaque and authoritarian system on a person who had absolutely no power to change it, she was able to triumph over these pangs of conscience by gathering her subconscious anger at the dissolution of social institutions by venal financial elites and displacing it onto a person she could actually confront without fear of retribution. Similarly successful were several bystanders in the checkout line, who sources confirmed were able to channel their own existential dread at the prospect of doing anything that might put at risk their ever-more precarious hold on what few creature comforts they did possess into making no effort to intervene. At press time, the deep-seated angst over living under a system that wants to make all human relationships transactional was successfully sublimated into apologizing to the screaming customer for the milk.\n"

        "Text": "WASHINGTON\u2014As businesses prepare for a looming economic recession, a government report released Wednesday found that more companies have chosen to cut costs by replacing CEOs with prison labor. \u201cAs firms both large and small seek to rein in expenditures, one increasingly common strategy is to replace the high-salaried chief executive and other C-suite occupants with much cheaper incarcerated laborers,\u201d stated the report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which found hundreds of instances in which companies\u2014from small businesses to large corporations like General Motors, Walmart, and Nike\u2014were now led by an imprisoned convict who was bused into corporate headquarters each day to perform all the functions of a CEO for an average of 40 cents per hour. \u201cAt a time when the average CEO makes nearly 400 times as much as a typical worker, and CEOs at large firms earn north of $25 million per year, more corporate boards are realizing that they can get the same amount of output from a prisoner who works for a fraction of the salary. In several states, including Florida, Georgia, and Texas, these prison CEOs are actually paid nothing for their work. While this raises some thorny ethical issues\u2014like the new incarcerated CEO of AT&T making no salary at all due to prison labor exemptions from federal wage laws\u2014there is no denying that many companies see major benefits from paying their CEOs virtually nothing and experience very few drawbacks with workflows.\u201d The report also found that while employees of these large firms had qualms about their company being led by an incarcerated individual, many acknowledged that their work-life balance had improved, as strict limits on prison phone time left the CEO unable to reach out to their employees around the clock.\n"

I know it's difficult to reveal private aspects of your life to another person, but it's time we took that step. People who love each other like we do should have no secrets excluding what happened on Mar. 2, 2004.\nAre you ready to share almost everything?\nIt may be a clich\u00e9, but it's true: A relationship is all about trust. It's the foundation upon which all else is built. That's why from now on, with the single exception of Mar. 2, 2004, I will be an open book. I want to know who you really are, imperfections and all. I want you to pour your life into mine and allow me to do the same with the minor stipulation that the incidents occurring between 1:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. on the aforementioned date, as well as their attendant aftermath, remain forever unexplored.\nThere is nothing that should go unsaid between us besides that one unspeakable thing.\nI don't want us to be one of those miserable couples who stays together for decades without ever really knowing each other. When we're old and gray, I want you to look over at me\u2014having been very, very careful never to have investigated, nor even wondered if there was anything to investigate, a tiny block of time from late winter six years ago\u2014and know you made the right choice with the right guy.\nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\nLook, we're both adults who've done our share of living, and the mistakes we've made have shaped us into the people we are today. Your past missteps, whatever they might have been, helped make you into the wonderful woman I love. And I'd like to think that my blunders were somehow responsible for making me into the man you love. Please note that by \"blunders,\" I'm referring to character-building lapses of judgment occurring before or after the date I am designating as functionally nonexistent, and not to any acts occurring on that date in a motel off the turnpike, in a back room of a Chinatown fish market, or anyplace else.\nIn other words, if you ever want me to sit down and open up\u2014really open up like you never thought possible\u2014about, say, Mar. 1, 2004, or possibly Mar. 3, 2004, I'd be happy to. Whenever, wherever.\nHey, for all I know, you might not have any big secrets. To be honest, if you omit the specific date in 2004 that we shall henceforth pretend never even existed, you'll find that I'm a pretty boring guy who never once frantically stuffed engraving plates into an old leather briefcase. But the important thing is that we can talk about anything unpleasant if and when we need to, presuming, of course, that the date I have placed into a kind of permanent temporal quarantine and my present-day ban on coming within 500 feet of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Cincinnati remain utterly beyond inquiry.\nAnd know that anything you say will stay between you, me, and the walls, oh, God, those dreary, wood-paneled walls and that sickly yellow light that hung there like death itself.\nThere's actually something I want to get off my chest right now if I could. Given our mutual understanding that the events of Mar. 2, 2004, including but not limited to what was done with the Serb and what ultimately got the screaming to stop, are to remain unexamined for as long as you live, I should probably confess that I once ran over a deer without stopping to check on it. For all I know, it was really hurt\u2026and I just kept right on driving. That might not be a big deal to a lot of people, but I still feel horrible about it.\nYou know what? Telling you that felt really good. I knew it would. Wow, it's almost like there's nothing, with one crucial and nonnegotiable exception, that I can't share with you. I'm so glad we had this talk. I love you, honey.\nOh, and, by the way, don't tell anyone we had this conversation, you understand? No one. I can't be held responsible for the actions of\u2020 Psycho Vince or the knife men if you do.\n"

No, unless I someday managed to climb behind the wheel of a garbage truck and meet another driver whose route goes by mine, that just isn\u2019t in the cards for me.\u201d At press time, Rossner was seen brushing away a tear as she noticed two trash collectors riding on the backs of the trucks reach over for a quick fist bump.\n"

        "Text": "On this International Women\u2019s Day, The Onion devotes its sterling reportage to championing women\u2014a small but influential sliver of the nation\u2019s population\u2014in an endeavor to prevent them from vanishing from the public consciousness entirely.\ufeff\nIn the nearly 250-year history of our nation, women\u2019s rights have come a long way. Women have earned the right to vote. Women have witnessed the passage of Title IX. Women have gone to space, have become leading scientists, and have climbed the corporate ladder to become some of America\u2019s most powerful CEOs. But despite this tremendous social progress, never once has there been a woman on top of the White House.\nFrankly, that\u2019s shameful. It\u2019s sexist, and it\u2019s wrong.\nIt\u2019s time to put a woman on the White House, where everyone can see her. It\u2019s more than just time\u2014it\u2019s long past overdue. It is urgent that we hoist a woman to the tip-top of the White House roof, where she\u2019ll be able to look out for our nation\u2019s best interests with what is practically a bird\u2019s-eye view of the South Lawn.\nIt\u2019s sad to think that this country may be so backwards that there are some people who don\u2019t even consider this a possibility.\nCan you imagine how much it would mean to millions of little girls across the country? To squint up at the roof of the White House and see someone who looks like themselves up there? To see a woman standing up there trying to keep her footing? To think, \u201cThat lady teetering and tottering back and forth in the wind could one day be me?\u201d I think the looks on their face would speak for themselves.\nWhat do Americans have against the idea of a woman on the commander-in-chief\u2019s rooftop? Around the world, women have been occupying the highest roofs of public office buildings for decades. In India, Indira Gandhi clung to the dome of the Secretariat Building as early as 1966. In England, Margaret Thatcher perched on top of 10 Downing Street for over a decade, earning her the nickname the Iron Lady for her uncompromising refusal to climb down from up there. Now why should the United States be any different? Where\u2019s our woman on the White House?\nOf course, we\u2019ve come close. Hillary Clinton nearly achieved the historic feat with her historic ascent of the White House\u2019s North Portico in 2016. Political analysts and experts, who were all but certain she\u2019d reach the gable, were stunned after Clinton made it all the way to gutter height before plummeting to the ground nearly 70 feet below.\nRest in power.\nWe can stew and speculate, asking ourselves if Clinton would have made it if only she had used a ladder, if only the eaves would have been a few inches shorter or her arms a few inches longer. But ultimately that kind of conjecture is only a useless distraction that makes us look backwards, instead of where we should be looking, which is up.\nImagine the Supreme Court building with nine women on top of it. If that image fills you with outrage or apprehension, I implore you to ask yourself: Why?\nI don\u2019t care if men can\u2019t picture a woman on the White House. The time for compromise has passed. She doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. If mediocre white men can go through life doing as they please, I don\u2019t see why there\u2019s any reason we shouldn\u2019t snatch the next woman we see walking down the National Mall and fling her on top of the White House with a construction crane.\nMark my words: In my lifetime, there will be a woman on that rooftop, waving her arms and screaming for help.\nGetting there won\u2019t be easy. As history has shown, there will be systemic barriers like gates and fences, strong gusts of wind, and Secret Service snipers. But if we give women our full support\u2014our shoulders, our step stools, our ladders, our cherry pickers, and our sturdy chairs\u2014eventually, one day, one of them will be stuck on the White House roof.\n"

We understand it is our duty to refuse to cross the picket line as we order Starbucks and use their free Wi-Fi to google locksmiths in the area.\nEmployees of The New York Times deserve the fair wages, health benefits, and retirement plans that their union is bargaining for, and amidst this deadlock, we have elected to discuss weekend plans and resist doing today\u2019s Wordle for as long as possible before giving in because we get too bored waiting for someone to let us into the building. \nSince their contract with then union expired in 2021, the New York Times\u2019 management has bargained in bad faith, a disgusting display of greed and disrespect for the noble journalists who work themselves to the bone to provide the lifeblood of the illustrious publication.

It reflects a policy that has already been implemented for numerous other members of the force, including Ol\u2019 Chokey, Sgt. Head Cracker, and the Wife Beater Brothers. Rest assured, Officer Branum will never live this down. Isn\u2019t that right, Mr. Jumpy?\u201d McDonald went on to acknowledge that he had once been administered a nickname himself, and that\u2019s why everyone in the department knew him as Chief Racist Murderer Guy.\n"

We found newly uncovered fossils of demarcated leaves that show clear terms of a primitive lease agreement, with stipulations about not painting the cave walls or placing anything besides toilet parchment inside the waste hole. The owner of the development, however, lived on the nicer side of the mountain, where the monthly offerings were delivered on a six-day journey via donkey, lest the tenants incur a late fee of 20 leech bites.\u201d Brownfield added that many roaming peoples of the time were seemingly only nomadic due to a lack of credit.\n"

This one looks like it\u2019s on a toasted Italian roll, too. I love it when they toast the bread. Makes it better.\u201d\n\u201cI like eggplant parms too,\u201d DiClaudino added. \u201cNot as much as chicken parms, though.\u201d\nUntil such time as the gigantic chicken parm can be contained or consumed, authorities have urged the American populace to cease all regular activity, head outside, and gaze longingly at the majestic expanse of the sandwich.\nIn addition, all government and economic functions have been suspended indefinitely in order for the nation to focus its resources and attention exclusively on the hovering sandwich, which sources reiterated is \u201ca real hot, drippy one\u2014you can tell it was made fresh.\u201d\n\u201cMy fellow Americans, we stand at the threshold of perhaps the most satisfying meal in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d said President Obama in a televised address to the nation this morning. \u201cIn fact, I am no longer your president. I am merely another hungry man looking to eat a big, sloppy chicken parm. I would advise all of you to try and bring the sandwich down to earth soon, while it is still warm. I certainly know that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. God damn it, is there anything more satisfying than a giant, messy parm that you house in about three minutes flat and that makes you feel absolutely disgusting after eating it but you don\u2019t regret it in the slightest because, Christ, it\u2019s a parm, ya know?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll get a little side order of marinara sauce so I can dip the sandwich in the sauce,\u201d the president added, staring into the sandwich as he walked slowly toward it.\n"

My sweet Dylan\u2019s going to be a bonafide sex pest to pretty much everyone around him while he stumbles down the bumpy road to maturity\u2014hell, he\u2019s probably going to try sticking it in a couple inanimate objects before the end of this thing. But however noxious his disgusting sexual appetites get, it shouldn\u2019t be more than four or five years before this phase passes. It may end even sooner if his perversion lands him in some kind of court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation program. And no matter how creepy he gets or how many times he jerks off each day, he\u2019ll always be my baby boy!\u201d Dylan\u2019s father added that while the teen would no doubt have questions about his newfound feelings, he could always turn to some of the foulest internet pornography imaginable for guidance.\n"

At press time, over 67,000 spectators at FedEx Field were heard cheering wildly after a second player was knocked unconscious, picked up on a stretcher, and  thrown into a mass grave on the Commanders sidelines.\n"

        "Text": "ZURICH, SWITZERLAND\u2014Nearly 700 scientists representing 27 countries convened at the University of Zurich Monday to formally announce that their experimentation on mice has been motivated not by a desire to advance human knowledge, but out of sheer distaste for the furry little rodents. \n\"As a man of science, I deal with facts, and the fact is that mice are gross,\" said Dr. Douglas White, chair of the Oxford biogenetics department and lifelong mouse-hater. \"They're squirmy, scurrying little vermin, and they make my skin crawl. I speak for all of my assembled colleagues when I say that the horrible little things deserve the worst we can dish out.\" \nAccording to a 500-word statement, scientists hate mice for \"their beady little eyes,\" \"their repulsive tails,\" and \"the annoying little squeaking sounds they make.\" \nAt the press conference, several scientists detailed their involvement in the centuries-long ruse of \"conducting experiments\" and \"curing diseases.\" \n\"For years, I've used lab mice to research cell breakdown in living tissue\u2014and I've been lucky enough to make some pretty important medical advancements along the way,\" said researcher Ellen Gresham of the Harvard Institute for Advanced Studies. \"But even if there were no scientific benefit to the work I do, I'd still experiment on mice, just to watch them suffer.\" \nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\n\"The truth is, mice are particularly ill-suited for our tissue study,\" Gresham added. \"We could construct a computer model that would yield more accurate results, but we don't care.\" \nAccording to Gresham, scientists have enjoyed dissolving mice in acid, spinning them in centrifuges, blowing them up in vacuum chambers, and forcing them to navigate exit-free mazes for years\u2014all the while towering above them, laughing. \n\"Every high-pitched squeak from the holding area is a warm reminder that the mice desperately want to escape,\" said Dr. Frances Villalobos, a contagious-disease researcher at the University of Mexico. \"All they want to do is get out from behind those bars so they can chew on everything, defecate all over, and poke their filthy twitching faces into piles of garbage. Well, I know of at least 80 little test subjects who won't be doing any more of that. They're headed straight for the dissection lab.\" \nVillalobos said he spent six months writing a grant proposal that provided him with funding to inject mice with the smallpox virus. \n\"It kills me that I can't infect the control group,\" Villalobos said. \"Unfortunately, if I infect them, I'll throw off my results. But once I complete this experiment, I'll rotate the control group into the hot seat. Don't you worry. They'll get what's coming to them.\" \nAfter applauding the scientists for coming forward, anthropologist Brent Wrigley suggested that the hatred of mice may be the single most important factor in the evolution of modern science. \n\"Despising mice may have pushed humanity out of the Stone Age,\" Wrigley said. \"After all, the cave habitats of early man must have been infested with the horrific little monsters. The entire history of human advancement via the scientific method may be a byproduct of the higher forebrain's natural revulsion toward the nasty critters.\" \nMouse-killing isn't solely the province of organic and medical scientists. Many other scientists kill mice, as well. \n\"As a physicist, I don't really have much cause to use mice in my regular research, which mostly requires the use of theoretical math,\" said Dr. Thomas Huber, author of the 1996 study Mouse Elasticity And Kinetic Rebound In High-Acceleration Collisions. \"But when I have the time, I like to send them flying into walls. Even just seeing them in a cage makes me feel kind of good inside. I like knowing I'm depriving them of their freedom, even if my research doesn't provide me the opportunity to cut them open.\" \n\"I hate those little fuckers,\" he added. \n"

Sheradon, whom sources confirmed had essentially been doing the work of a seasoned New York City media professional with a six-figure salary and a Rolodex of industry contacts, reportedly spent the last several days drumming up press about the six-part nature-based docuseries; penning effusive posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok; and urging everyone in her immediate circle to tune in each week for the premiere. The show, which followed an intrepid family of orca whales as they crossed the ocean together, reportedly caught Sheradon\u2019s eye so much that by the time the finale aired, the retired mother of three had mounted a full-on media blitz, even going so far as to post a 2,000-word tribute to show, commenting repeatedly on the show\u2019s official pages with the heart emoji, and changing her avatar to the show\u2019s logo of two smiling, hugging whales. At press time, Sheradon\u2019s accounts on several social media platforms had reportedly been flagged and removed for misconduct after the show was suddenly cancelled and she attempted to incite a coordinated cyberbullying campaign against the Disney corporation to have it renewed for Season 2.\n"

With Christmas just a few short days away, Santa is hard at work making toys, loading his sleigh, and getting ready to deliver presents to all of his favorite children around the world! While so many of you have strived to make Santa\u2019s good list this year, Old St. Nick has unfortunately heard that there are some very, very naughty boys and girls out there who are wielding their incredible wealth, connections, and power to have me killed.\nGather round, little ones, and listen here, because there are some hearts that aren\u2019t overflowing with cheer! \nA cabal of elite pedophiles wants Santa dead, because I, Father Christmas, know everything they\u2019ve done, and have threatened to expose their decades-long, secret involvement in a worldwide child trafficking ring!\nHo, ho, ho! You see, my sweet little sugar plums, Santa made his list and checked it twice and found that the most powerful members of society spent decades illegally kidnapping special little children just like you and selling them into sex slavery! \nSanta\u2019s little elves have been keeping especially close tabs on the billionaires, celebrities, and former U.S. presidents. And the sad thing is, my dear children, they\u2019ve realized the only way to bury this, before word gets out, is to put a bullet through jolly old St. Nick\u2019s brain!\u201d\nUp to 20 hours of battery It\u2019s ruggedly durable so it can withstand any accidental bumps or drops and the waterproof casing makes it a perfect fit for any outdoor activity like taking to the beach or pool\nOh yes indeed, Santa has seen everything! He\u2019s seen dark money. He\u2019s seen drugs. Why, this right old jolly elf has even seen the flight logs! That\u2019s right! And do you know what Santa found? That the machine that enables these insidious crimes goes straight to the top of every major government, corporation, and industry on the planet.\n And Santa has just started to scratch the surface!\nThe police, you say? Oh, my dear, perfect darlings! May the sweet songs of carolers always fill your innocent little heads! \nYou see, young ones, these sick, hideously wealthy perverts have paid off everyone, from law enforcement, to top government officials, to the highest courts in all the land. They do their business openly, because they know they can. Unlike dear Santa, they do not ever have to hide!\n\u2019Tis the season, my darlings, for Santa to keep a close watch on his six. \nThe truth is, boys and girls, there\u2019s nowhere in the world that Santa is safe! Every continent! Every country. Why, this elite group of child abusers even have their tentacles here, all the way up at the North Pole! Call Santa paranoid, but I\u2019m beginning to think that I can\u2019t even trust my elves, my reindeer, or even my dear, sweet wife, Mrs. Clause. Who knows? They could have paid her off to kill me. \nOr Mrs. Clause might be a sicko perv.\nOld Saint Nick won\u2019t be hanging up too many Christmas lights at the North Pole this year, because he knows the powerful elite will just use them to string up his corpse from the rafters of Santa\u2019s Workshop. \nNow, don\u2019t be naive, sweet little ones. If Santa dies, they will make it look like an accident. When their trained squad of goons finally snaps my neck, injects me with poison, or shoots me in the head, they\u2019ll tie Santa\u2019s limp, bloodied corpse to the back of his sled. \nAs sure as Old Saint Nick\u2019s round belly shakes a bowl full of jelly, the media will report it as a suicide. But you\u2019ll know better. Yes you will, boys and girls!\nSanta sees you when you\u2019re sleeping. He knows when you\u2019re awake! And Santa knows Jeffrey Epstein may have been naughty, but he sure as shit didn\u2019t hang himself! \nYou see, old Kris Kringle might have a jolly laugh, a big pink nose, and a twinkle in his eye, but by golly, he\u2019s no damn fool. Santa knows there\u2019s a target on his back, killers on his tail, and a bounty on his head for a cool $10 million. \nBut boys and girls, do you think he won\u2019t defend himself? Ho, ho, ho! Of course Santa is packing and it\u2019s the best present he ever got for himself. A Glock 43! \nWell, your dear friend Santa has probably said too much already, dear little ones. But just remember that come Christmas, if no one slides down your chimney, places presents under the tree, or brings cheer to the world, then Santa is definitely, 100% dead.\nAlso, never repeat any of this. Because guess what? They\u2019ll kill you too!\n"

I don\u2019t want to make this decision lightly, so I really want to take my time with Emelda and Hexe, going through all the incantations that will help me settle on a course of action. I\u2019m just really glad I have my coven of witches to help me decide. Not only have they been with me since the beginning of my career, but they also created me.\u201d At press time, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst reportedly awoke tied up in a mysterious chamber as a croaking old female voice asked him whether he was prepared to convince Rodgers to return for another season as the team\u2019s quarterback by sacrificing backup Jordan Love.\n"
